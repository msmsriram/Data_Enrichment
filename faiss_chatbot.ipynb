      "Go to Health Professional VersionKey PointsGood communication between people with cancer, their family,  and the health care team is important in cancer care.Families may experience communication challenges.Good communication between people with cancer, their family,  and the health care team is important in cancer care.Good communication with your family and the health care team can create a trusting relationship that positively affects many parts of your cancer journey. The goals of good communication in cancer care are to:Build a trusting relationship with your health care team.\tLearn from your health care team about your cancer diagnosis.Discuss your options for treatment and care throughout your cancer journey.Improve your well-being and quality of life. You will face many decisions when you are diagnosed with cancer. Tell your health care team about concerns you may have during treatment, and if you have problems coping with the cancer diagnosis and journey.Studies show that there are many positive results  when people with cancer and their doctors communicate well during cancer care. Positive results include:More satisfaction with care.More likely to follow through with treatment.Better quality of life.Reduced anxiety and other symptoms.More likely to take part in a clinical trial.Improved knowledge of the disease and prognosis.Preferred care is received at end of life.Ask for a patient navigator  if you need help communicating with your doctor. A patient navigator can guide you through the health care system and help you communicate with your health care team, so you get the information you need to make decisions about your care. Families may experience communication challenges.Cancer can be an emotional experience. You may want to hide feelings of distress and sadness and act normal  to protect your family and friends. This is also often true for friends and family. Talking about cancer-related issues may help reduce stress for you  and your family. Family-focused psychotherapy may also benefit you and your family.\n",

      "Cultural and Demographic Factors in Communication\n",
      "Key PointsPeople may have a preferred way to receive information from their health care team.Culture can also affect communication.People may have a preferred way to receive information from their health care team.You may ask for written instructions and  phone calls, or you may prefer texts and emails. Let your health care team know how you want to receive your information about your cancer and cancer treatment.Culture can also affect communication.Some cultures place a greater emphasis on communication with the family as a whole unit, while other cultures focus more on the patient’s ability to make their own decisions. Tell your health care team how much information you want to receive.Your religious beliefs may be a source of strength and coping for you. Tell your health care team about any spiritual and religious needs and concerns you want them to know about. For more information, see Spirituality in Cancer Care.\n",

      "Key PointsMany parents want to know their child’s prognosis.Children with cancer need information that is right for their age.Children may wish to know what is going on when someone they love has cancer.Many parents want to know their child’s prognosis.When your child has cancer, you will likely have questions about how serious the cancer is, and your child’s chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis. Learning your child’s prognosis may be upsetting, but knowing this information can help you and your loved ones make decisions. Your child’s doctor is in the best position to talk with you about your child’s prognosis, if you want to know that information.Children with cancer need information that is right for their age.Studies show that children with cancer want to know about their illness and how it will be treated. The amount of information a child may want to know  depends in part on their age. Most children worry about how their illness and treatment will affect their daily lives and the people around them. Studies also show that children have less doubt and fear when they are given age-appropriate  information about their illness, even if it is bad news.Children may wish to know what is going on when someone they love has cancer.When a parent has cancer, the child may have high levels of distress. Children may also experience anxiety and distress when they see a sibling going through cancer therapy or dying. Children do better when family members or the health care team talk with them about what to expect and answer their questions.

      "About This PDQ Summary\n",
      "About PDQPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about communicating with the cancer patient and his or her family.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.Reviewers and UpdatesEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\n",
      "The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board.\n",
      "Clinical Trial InformationA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n",
      "Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).\n",

      "Go to Health Professional VersionCancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. In 2023, about 1.9 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States. In addition to the physical problems and emotional distress caused by cancer, the high costs of care are also a burden to patients, their families, and to the public. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer  is lowered. Hopefully, this will reduce the burden of cancer and lower the number of deaths caused by cancer.Cancer is not a single disease but a group of related diseases. Many things in our genes, our lifestyle, and the environment around us may increase or decrease our risk of getting cancer.Scientists are  studying many different  ways to  help prevent cancer, including the following:Ways to avoid or control things known to cause cancer.Changes in diet and lifestyle.Finding precancerous conditions early. Precancerous conditions are conditions that may become cancer.Chemoprevention (medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting).Risk-reducing surgery.\n",

      "Carcinogenesis\n",
      "Key PointsCarcinogenesis is the process in which normal cells turn into cancer cells.Changes (mutations) in genes occur during carcinogenesis.Carcinogenesis is the process in which normal cells turn into cancer cells.Carcinogenesis is the series of steps that take place as a normal cell becomes a cancer cell. Cells are the smallest units of the body and they make up the body's tissues. Each cell contains   genes that guide the way the body grows, develops, and repairs itself. There are many genes that control whether a cell lives or dies, divides (multiplies), or takes on special functions, such as becoming a nerve cell or a muscle cell.Changes (mutations) in genes occur during carcinogenesis.Changes (mutations) in genes can cause normal  controls in cells to break down. When this happens, cells do not die when they should and new cells are produced when the body does not need them. The buildup of extra cells may cause a mass (tumor) to form.Tumors can be benign or malignant (cancerous). Malignant tumor cells invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumor cells do not invade nearby tissues or spread.\n"

      " The National Cancer Institute (NCI) manages the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), which is a collaborative research network that conducts and supports clinical trials for adult cancers in the United States. The NCTN includes four adult cooperative groups: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG), and the Children's Oncology Group (COG).\n",
      "\n",
      "The NCTN groups propose concepts for new clinical trials to the NCI Disease/Imaging Steering Committees, which are responsible for evaluating and prioritizing new clinical trials. The committees consist of NCTN group members, disease experts not involved in leadership positions in the groups, biostatisticians, patient advocates, and NCI disease experts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall NCTN budget is $171 million, which allows for an annual enrollment of about 17,000-20,000 participants on cancer treatment and imaging trials. The collaborative approach of the NCTN groups reduces costs by sharing resources, such as a common data management system (Medidata Rave) and integrated IT system for tissue banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional support for the NCTN includes Central Institutional Review Boards, the Cancer Trials Support Unit, dedicated tissue banks for each Network group, the Biomarker, Imaging, and Quality of Life Studies Funding Program, and funding from the NCORP program. NCI also pays for essential clinical trial functions, such as electronic data management system licenses and hosting fees, national audit system oversight, and Investigational New Drug applications to the Food and Drug Administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collaboration among the groups is critical to success and is now specifically rewarded at grant review. Efficiency is also stressed, with mandatory timelines in place for protocol development. The NCTN plays a vital role in advancing cancer research through clinical trials."
