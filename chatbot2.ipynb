Important immune -mediated \\nadverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and \\nfatal immune -mediated reactions.  \\nImmune -mediated adverse re actions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ \\nsystem or tissue. Immune -mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting a PD -\\n1/PD -L1 blocking antibody. While immune -mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during \\ntreatment  with PD -1/PD -L1 blocking antibodies, immune -mediated adverse reactions can also \\nmanifest after discontinuation of PD -1/PD -L1 blocking antibodies.  \\nEarly identification and management of immune -mediated adverse reactions are essential to \\nensure safe use of  PD-1/PD -L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and \\nsigns that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune -mediated adverse reactions. \\nEvaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically duri ng \\ntreatment. In cases of suspected immune -mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup \\nto exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, \\nincluding specialty consultation as appropriate.  \\nWithhold or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ depending on severity [see Dosage and \\nAdministration (2.3)]. In general, if TECENTRIQ requires interruption or discontinuation, \\nadminister systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until \\nimprovement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid \\ntaper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic \\nimmunosuppressants in patients whose immune -mediated adverse reactions are not controlled \\nwith corticosteroid therapy.

Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.  \\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and \\nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.  \\nData  \\nAnimal Data  \\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with TECENTRIQ to evaluate its effect on \\nreproduction and fetal development. A literature -based assessment o f the effects on reproduction \\ndemonstrated that a central function of the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by \\nmaintaining maternal immune tolerance to a fetus. Blockage of PD -L1 signaling has been shown \\nin murine models of pregnancy to disrupt t olerance to a fetus and to result in an increase in fetal \\nloss; therefore, potential risks of administering TECENTRIQ during pregnancy include increased \\nrates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to \\nthe blockade of PD -L1/PD -1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune -\\nmediated disorders occurred in PD -1 and PD -L1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of \\naction, fetal exposure to atezolizumab may increase the risk of developing immune -mediated \\ndisorders or altering the normal immune response.   \\n8.2 Lactation  \\nRisk Summary  \\nThere is no information regarding the presence of atezolizumab in human milk, the effects on the \\nbreastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. As human IgG is excreted in human milk, the \\npotential for absorption and harm to the infant is unknown.

Atezolizumab is \\nan Fc -engineered, humanized, non -glycosylated IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin that has a \\ncalculated molecular mass of 145  kDa.  \\nTECENTRIQ  (atezolizumab)  injection for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative -free, \\ncolorless to slightly yellow solution in single -dose vials. Each 20 mL vial contains 1200  mg of \\natezolizumab and is formulated in glacial acetic acid (16.5 mg), L -histidine (62 mg), \\npolysorbate  20 (8 mg), and sucrose (821.6 mg), with a pH  of 5.8. Each 14 mL vial contains 840 \\nmg of atezolizumab and is formula ted in glacial acetic acid (11.5 mg), L -histidine (43.4 mg), \\npolysorbate 20 (5.6 mg), and sucrose (575.1 mg) with a pH of 5.8.  \\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \\n12.1 Mechanism of Action  \\nPD L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and/or tumor infiltrating immune cells an d can \\ncontribute to the inhibition of the anti -tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. \\nBinding of PD L1 to the PD 1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells and antigen presenting cells \\nsuppresses cytotoxic T -cell activity, T -cell proliferation and  cytokine production.  \\nAtezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD L1 and blocks its interactions with both \\nPD 1 and B7.1 receptors. This releases the PD L1/PD 1 mediated inhibition of the immune \\nresponse, including activation of the anti -tumor i mmune response without inducing antibody -\\ndependent cellular cytotoxicity. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD L1 activity \\nresulted in decreased tumor growth.  \\nIn mouse models of cancer, dual inhibition of the PD-1/PD -L1 and MAPK pathways suppresses \\ntumor growth and improves tumor immunogenicity through increased antigen presentation and T \\ncell infiltration and activation compared to targeted therapy alone.   \\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics  \\nThe exposure -response relationship and time course of pharmac odynamic response for the safety \\nand effectiveness of atezolizumab have not been fully characterized.  \\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics  \\nAtezolizumab exposure increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 1  mg/kg to \\n20 mg/kg (0.07 to 1.33 times of the approved recommended doses), including a dose of 1200  mg \\nadministered every 3  weeks. Steady state was achieved after 6 to 9 weeks foll owing multiple \\ndoses. The systemic accumulation ratio for every 2 weeks administration and every 3 weeks \\nadministration is 3.3 - and 1.9 - fold, respectively.  \\nDistribution  \\nThe volume of distribution at steady state is 6.9 L.  \\nElimination  \\nThe clearance (CV%)  is 0.2 L/day (29%) and the terminal half -life is 27 days. Atezolizumab \\nclearance was found to decrease over time, with a mean maximal reduction (CV%) from baseline \\nvalue of 17% (41%); however, the decrease in clearance was not considered clinically releva nt. \\nSpecific Populations  ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Barani\\\\Desktop\\\\local_ollama\\\\drugs_merged.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",

In study IMpower150, the \\nimpact of ADA on efficacy did not appear to be clinically significant [see Clinical Studies \\n(14.1)] . In the remaining studies, th ere is insufficient information to characterize the effect of \\nADA on efficacy.  \\nThe presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of \\nadverse reactions.  \\nAcross clinical studies, 4.3% to 27.5% of neutralizing antib ody (NAb) -evaluable patients had a \\npositive NAb status at any timepoint post -treatment.

TECENTRIQ may be used with the \\nchemotherapy medicines carboplatin and etoposide as your first treatment when your lung cancer   \\no is a type called “extensive -stage SCLC,” whi ch means that it has spread or grown.  \\n• adults with a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TECENTRIQ may be used with the \\nmedicine bevacizumab when your liver cancer : \\no has spread or cannot be removed by surgery, and \\no you have not received other medicines by mouth or injection through your vein (IV) to treat your cancer.  \\n• adults with a type of skin cancer called melanoma.  TECENTRIQ may be used with the medicines cobimetinib  \\nand vemurafenib when your melanoma : \\no has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery, and \\no has a certain type of abnormal “BRAF” gene. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure this \\nTECENTRIQ combination is right for yo u. \\n• adults and children 2 years of age and older with a type of soft tissue tumor (cancer) called alveolar soft part \\nsarcoma (ASPS).  TECENTRIQ may be used when your sarcoma:  \\no has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery.  \\nIt is not known if TECENTRIQ is safe and effective when used:  \\n• in children younger than 2 years of age for the treatment of ASPS.  \\n• in children for the treatment of NSCLC, SCLC, HCC, or melanoma.

The product does  not contain an anti-microbia l preservative. \\n 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Faricimab is a humaniz ed bispecific antibody that acts through inhibition of two pathways by \\nbinding to VEGF-A and Ang-2. By i nhibiting VEGF-A, faricimab su ppresses endothelial cell \\nproliferation, neovasculariza tion and vascular permeability. By  inhibiting Ang-2, faricimab is \\nthought to promote vascular sta bility and desensitize blood ves sels to the effects of VEGF-A. \\nAng-2 levels are increased in som e patients with nAMD, DME, and  RVO. The contribution of \\nAng-2 inhibition to the treatme nt effect and clinical response for nAMD,  DME, and RVO has \\nyet to be established.   12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increased retinal thickness, a ssessed by optical  coherence tomo graphy (OCT), is associated with \\nnAMD, DME and macular edema following RVO. Leakage of blood and  fluid from choroidal \\nneovascularization, assessed by f luorescein angiography, is ass ociated with nAMD. Reductions \\nin CST were observed across al l treatment arms throughout the s ix Phase 3 studies in nAMD, \\nDME, and RVO.  12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption/Distribution Maximum faricimab plasma concentr ations (Cmax) are estimated to  occur approximately 2 days \\npost-dose. Mean (±SD) free fa ricimab (unbound to VEGF-A and Ang -2) plasma Cmax are \\nestimated to be 0.23 (0.07) m cg/mL and 0.22 (0.07) mcg/mL in nA MD and in DME patients, \\nrespectively. After repeated int ravitreal administrations, mean  plasma free faricimab trough \\nconcentrations are predicte d to be 0.002-0.003 mcg/mL for every  8 weeks (Q8W) dosing and \\n0.021-0.029 mcg/mL for every 4 wee ks (Q4W) dosing. Although not  directly measured in the \\nvitreous, no accumulation of faric imab is expected in the vitre ous and no accumulation has been \\nobserved in plasma when faricimab  has been administered as repe at doses in the vitreous.  \\n Metabolism/Elimination Metabolism and elimination of faric imab has not been fully char acterized. Faricimab is expected \\nto be catabolized in lysosomes to small peptides and amino acid s, which may be excreted \\nrenally, in a similar manner t o the elimination of endogenous I gG. The estimated mean apparent \\nsystemic half-life of faricima b is approximately 7.5 days. \\n Specific Populations The systemic pharmacokinetics of  faricimab were not influenced by gender, race, or mild to \\nsevere renal impairment (i.e., e stimated normaliz ed creatinine clearance by Cockroft-Gault \\nequation: 15 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m\\n2). The effect of severe renal  impairment or any degree of \\nhepatic impairment on the pharm acokinetics of VABYSMO is unknow n. No special dosage \\nmodification is required for any of the populations that have b een studied (e.g., elderly, gender, \\nrace).  Population pharmacokinetic analysi s indicated that the pharmaco kinetics of faricimab are \\ncomparable in nAMD, DME, and RVO patients.   12.6 Immunogenicity The immunogenicity of VABYSMO was  evaluated in plasma samples.

Patients were \\nrandomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of  two treatment arms: 1) afli bercept 2 mg administered fixed \\nevery 8 weeks (Q8W) after three initial monthly doses; and VABY SMO 6 mg (0.05 mL of 120 \\nmg/mL solution) administered by in travitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 ± \\n7 days, monthly) for the first 4 doses, followed by optical coh erence tomography and visual \\nacuity evaluations 8 and 12 weeks later to determine whether to  give a 6 mg (0.05 mL of 120 \\nmg/mL solution) dose via intrav itreal injection on one of the f ollowing three regimens: 1) Weeks \\n28 and 44; (also referred to as Q16W dosing); 2) Weeks 24, 36 a nd 48 (also referred to as Q12W \\ndosing); or 3) Weeks 20, 28, 36 and 44 (also referred to as Q8W  dosing). However, the utility of \\nthese criteria to guide dosing int ervals has not been establish ed. \\n At week 48, after 4 initial monthl y doses in the VABYSMO arm, 4 5% of patients received the  \\nWeeks 28 and 44 dosing, 33% of patients received the Weeks 24, 36 and 48 dosing, and the \\nremaining 22% of patients receive d dosing every 8 weeks. These percentages are reflective of \\nwhat happened within the conduct of  these trials and indicate t hat some patients did well on two \\n(2) doses spaced 16 weeks apart, or three (3) doses spaced 12 w eeks apart, but the percentages \\nmay not be generalizable to a br oader nAMD population for a var iety of reasons. The \\ninclusion/exclusion criteria limited enrollment to a select sub set of treatment naive, newly \\ndiagnosed nAMD patients and there  is no empirical  data that a s\\nimilar magnitude would be \\nobserved if eligibility criteria allowed for broader enrollment . The disease activity criteria, which \\nwas instrumental in determini ng dose frequency, is unvalidated.  Stricter criteria would have \\nchanged how patients were treat ed resulting in different percen tages of subjects in each dose \\ninterval cohort. There was not a  similarly dose d aflibercept ar m for comparison, which makes the \\npercentages difficul t to interpret.  \\n ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Barani\\\\Desktop\\\\local_ollama\\\\drugs_merged.pdf', 'page': 98}),\n",

As a result, pertuzumab inhibits ligand -initiated intracellular signaling \\nthrough two major signaling pathways, mitogen -activated protein (MAP) kinase and \\nphosphoinositide  3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of these signaling pathways can result in cell growth \\narrest and apoptosis, respectively.  \\nTrastuzumab binds to subdomain IV of the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein to inhibit the \\nligand -independent, HER2 mediated cell proliferation and PI3K signal ing pathway in human \\ntumor cells that overexpress HER2.  \\nBoth pertuzumab and trastuzumab -mediated antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity \\n(ADCC) have been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer ce lls \\ncompared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2.  \\nWhile pertuzumab alone inhibited the proliferation of human tumor cells, the combination of \\npertuzumab and trastuzumab  augmented anti -tumor activity in HER2 -overexpressing xenograft \\nmodels.  \\nHyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue . It is \\ndepolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase. Unlike the stable structural \\ncomponents of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a half -life of approximately 0.5 days. \\nHyaluronidase increases permeability of the  subcutaneous tissue by depolymerizing hyaluronan. \\nIn the doses administered, hyaluronidase in PHESGO  acts transiently and locally.

Each bottle contains 60 mg of \\nrisdiplam. The inactive ingredients of EVRYSDI are: ascorbic acid, disodium edetate dihydrate, \\nisomalt, mannitol, polyethylene glycol  6000, sodium benzoate, strawberry flavor, sucralose, and \\ntartaric acid.  \\nThe powder is constituted with purified water to yield 60 mg/80 mL (0.75 mg/mL) of risdiplam \\nafter constitution [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].  \\n', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Barani\\\\Desktop\\\\local_ollama\\\\drugs_merged.pdf', 'page': 136}),\n",

Using in vitro assays and studies in transgenic anima l models of SMA, \\nrisdiplam was shown to increase exon 7 inclusion in SMN2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) \\ntranscripts and production of full -length SMN protein in the brain. \\nIn vitro and in vivo data indicate that risdiplam may cause alternative splicing of additional \\ngenes, including FOXM1 and MADD. FOXM1 and MADD are thought to be involved in cell \\ncycle regulation and apoptosis, respectively, and have been identified as poss ible contributors to \\nadverse effects seen in animals.  \\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics  \\nIn clinical trials  for infantile -onset SMA and later -onset SMA patients , EVRYSDI led to an \\nincrease in SMN protein with a greater than 2‑fold median change from baseline within 4 weeks \\nof treatment initiation  across all SMA types studied. The increase was sustained throughout the \\ntreatment period (of at least 24 months).  \\nCardiac Electrophysiology \\nAt the maximum recommended dose, clinically significant QTc interval prolongation was not \\nobserved.  \\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics  \\nPharmacokinetics of EVRYSDI have been characterized in healthy adult subjects and in patients \\nwith SMA.  \\nAfter administration of EVRYSDI as an oral solution, pharmacokinetics of risdiplam were \\napproximately linear between 0.6 and  18 mg in a single -ascending -dose study in healthy adult \\nsubjects, and between 0.02 and 0.25 mg/kg once daily in a multiple -ascendin g-dose study in \\npatients with SMA. Following once -daily oral administration of risdiplam in healthy subjects, \\napproximately 3- fold accumulation of peak plasma concentrations (C max) and area under the \\nplasma concentration -time curve (AUC 0-24h) was observed. Risdiplam exposures reach steady \\nstate 7 to 14 days after once -daily administration.  \\nAbsorption \\nFollowing oral administration, the time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T max) is \\nbetween 1 and 4 hours.  \\nEffect of Food  \\nIn the clinical efficacy studies (Study 1 and Study 2), risdiplam was administered with a morning \\nmeal or after breastfeeding.  \\nDistribution  \\nThe apparent volume of distribution at steady state is 190.4 L for a 31.3 kg patient. \\nRisdiplam is predominantly bound to serum albumin, without any binding to alpha -1 acid \\nglycoprotein, with a free fraction of 11%.  \\nElimination  \\nThe apparent clearance (CL/F) of risdiplam is 2.45 L/h for a 31.3 kg patient.

However, other studies indicate that there might be an increased risk of breast cancer in women who have their first full-term pregnancy at a younger age or who have their last full-term pregnancy at an older age. This could be due to the longer exposure to hormones like estrogen during pregnancy and menstruation.\n",
      "3. The context also mentions that having never been pregnant is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, which is not breast cancer but is related to hormonal imbalances.\n",
      "4. It's important to note that the relationship between pregnancy and breast cancer risk is complex and multifactorial, and more research is needed to fully understand it. The context suggests that other factors like family history, genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposures also play a role in breast cancer risk.\n",
