       "[Document(page_content=\"Human/Clinical Studies\\nMost of the information presented here is summarized in a\\ntable located at the end of this section. Hydrazine sulfate has been studied extensively in patients with advanced\\ncancer.  These studies have evaluated the following: a) tumor response and/or\\nsurvival among patients with various types of cancer,[1-13] b)\\nchanges in body weight,[1-6,8,10-12,14] c) carefully measured\\nquality of life,[4-6,15] and d)\\nchanges in nutritional or metabolic\\nstatus.[1,4,12,13,16,17]  Clinical studies of hydrazine sulfate have been\\nfunded by a pharmaceutical company,[3] the Russian government,[7,9,10,18]\\nand by grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI).[1,2,4-6,8,11,12,15,16]  They have also been\\nsponsored by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) [5,6] and the\\nCancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).[4,15] The first clinical tests of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for cancer\\nwere conducted in the mid-1970s by a pharmaceutical company.[3]  In an uncontrolled study of 158\\npatients with advanced disease, it was found that 45 of 84 evaluable patients had\\nsubjective improvements (i.e., the patients reported an increase in appetite,\\na decrease in weight loss, an increase in strength, or a decrease in pain) and\\nthat 14 had objective improvements (i.e., there was measurable tumor regression, stable disease, or improvement in a\\ncancer-related disorder) in response to treatment with hydrazine sulfate. \\nAmong the patients with objective responses, two had long-term (17 and 18\\nmonths) stabilization of their disease and seven had measurable tumor\\nregression, although the extent and duration of these  regressions were not\\nspecified.  Major weaknesses of this study included the absence of a control\\n(i.e., comparison) group and the fact that 74 of the 158 initially recruited\\npatients could not be evaluated because of poor prognosis, missing documentation,\\ninsufficient duration of treatment, and/or concurrent therapy (i.e.,\\ntherapy given at the same time) with other anticancer drugs.[3]In 1976, Russian investigators reported findings from 95 patients with\\nadvanced cancer who had been treated with hydrazine sulfate after all previous\\ntherapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) had\\nfailed.[9]  Three partial responses (i.e.,\\nreductions in tumor size of greater than 50% observed for a period of 4 weeks\\nor more) and no complete responses were noted\\nafter 1 to 5 months of treatment.  Tumor regressions of 50% or less and stable\\ndisease (i.e., cessation of tumor growth for a period of 1.5 to 2.0 months or\\nmore) were reported for 16 and 20 patients, respectively.In 1981, the same investigators published findings from 225 patients with\\nadvanced disease who had been treated with hydrazine sulfate after all\\nprevious therapy had failed.[10] It appears that the 225 patients described in\\nthis second report [10] included the 95 patients described in the first\\nreport.[9]  Partial responses and stable disease were reported for 4 and\\n95 patients, respectively, after 1 to 6 months of treatment.  No patient\\nexperienced a complete response.  Subjective improvements in appetite, weight\\nstabilization or gain, pain, fever, breathing, and/or mental outlook were\\nreported by 147 patients.In 1995, the same Russian investigators published findings from 740\\npatients with advanced cancer.[7]  Once again, it appears that 225 of these\\n740 patients were described in the earlier reports.[9,10]  Partial responses\\nand stable disease were reported for 25 and 263 patients, respectively. \\nComplete responses were noted for six patients.  Subjective improvements in\\ncancer-related symptoms were reported by\\n344 patients.In 1994, the same investigators reported findings from a clinical series involving 46\\npatients with malignant brain tumors\\n(38 with glioblastomas, four with\\nastrocytomas, and four with meningiomas) and six patients with benign brain tumors.[18]  These patients\\nwere not described in the other reports.[7,9,10]  All patients in this\\nseries appear to have been treated with surgery in addition to hydrazine\\nsulfate therapy, and at least some of the patients were also treated with\\nradiation therapy.  Complete or partial regression of neurologic  symptoms (e.g., seizures,\\nheadaches, sensory and motor disorders, and hallucinations) was\\nreported for 73% of the patients.  In addition, longer-than-average survival\\nwas reported for most patients.  Among the patients with glioblastomas, the\\nincrease in average survival time was from 6 months to more than 13\\nmonths.[18]Evaluation of the findings from these Russian clinical series [7,9,10,18]\\nis made difficult by the limited information provided about the patients and\\ntheir treatment histories.  In addition, insufficient information was given\\nabout study design and methodology.  The absence of control groups; the\\nreceipt of prior or concurrent surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy\\nby all patients; and the reliance on subjective measures of  quality of life\\nare major study weaknesses.  Therefore, it is difficult to ascribe any of the\\npositive findings to treatment with hydrazine sulfate. In contrast with the\\npreviously described clinical series, three NCI-funded clinical series found\\nno complete responses or partial responses among a total of 79 patients\\ntreated with hydrazine sulfate.[2,8,11] In addition, only temporary, minor\\nimprovements in appetite, pain, and weight stabilization or gain were reported\\nby the patients in these series. A weakness in these three clinical series was\\nthe absence of control groups.Findings from four placebo-controlled, randomized clinical\\ntrials, however, also fail to support the effectiveness of hydrazine sulfate\\nas a cancer treatment in humans.[1,4-6,15]  In these trials,\\nsurvival,[1,4-6,15] objective tumor response,[1,4,15] and carefully measured\\nquality of life [4-6,15] were major endpoints. One of the trials involved 65 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and examined the effects of hydrazine sulfate\\non survival and nutritional status.[1]  In this trial, patients received\\neither hydrazine sulfate or placebo in addition to a multiple-drug\\nchemotherapy regimen.  When all patients were evaluated, no improvement in\\nsurvival was found with hydrazine sulfate therapy.  In addition, no\\ndifferences were noted in objective tumor response between the hydrazine\\nsulfate group and the placebo group.  However, on the basis of caloric intake and the maintenance\\nof serum albumin levels, the\\nnutritional status of the patients in the hydrazine sulfate group was judged\\nbetter than that of the patients in the placebo group.  However, the moderate\\nincreases in body weight associated with hydrazine sulfate use did not achieve\\nstatistical significance.A CALGB-sponsored trial also evaluated the use of hydrazine sulfate as a\\ntreatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.[4,15]  In\\nthis trial, 266 patients received either hydrazine sulfate or placebo in\\naddition to a multiple-drug chemotherapy regimen.  No differences in survival,\\nobjective tumor response, anorexia, weight gain or loss, or nutritional status\\nwere observed between the hydrazine sulfate group and the placebo group. \\nHowever, the quality of life of the patients who received hydrazine sulfate\\nwas found to be statistically significantly worse than that of the patients\\nwho received placebo.The use of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for patients with non-small\\ncell lung cancer was also evaluated in an NCCTG-sponsored trial.[6]  In this\\ntrial, 243 patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrazine sulfate\\nor placebo in addition to a multiple-drug chemotherapy regimen.  No\\nstatistically significant differences were found between the hydrazine sulfate\\ngroup and the placebo group with respect to either survival or \\nquality of life.Another NCCTG-sponsored trial tested hydrazine sulfate alone versus\\nplacebo in the treatment of 127 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.[5]  In this trial,\\nthe patients who received hydrazine sulfate had, on average, shorter survival\\nthan the patients who received placebo, a finding that was statistically\\nsignificant.  There were no statistically significant differences between the\\nhydrazine sulfate group and the placebo group with respect to weight gain or\\nloss, anorexia, or quality of life.Four other clinical trials did find some objective evidence of benefit with\\nhydrazine sulfate therapy.[12,13,16,17]  These trials had either nutritional\\nstatus or metabolic status as the primary endpoint.  In a placebo-controlled,\\nrandomized trial involving 38 patients with advanced disease, hydrazine\\nsulfate was found to improve the abnormal glucose metabolism seen in cancer patients.[13] \\nIn another placebo-controlled, randomized trial that involved 101 patients\\nwith advanced cancer and weight loss, the use of hydrazine sulfate was\\nassociated with statistically significant improvements in appetite and either\\nweight increase or weight maintenance.[12]  However, the higher average\\ncaloric intake observed in this study for patients treated with hydrazine\\nsulfate compared with patients treated with placebo was not statistically\\nsignificant.[12]  Two other clinical studies involving a total of 34 patients\\nwith either lung cancer or colon cancer found that hydrazine sulfate was able\\nto reduce the body protein breakdown associated with cancer cachexia.[16,17] \\nIn view of the totality of evidence, the overall importance of the findings\\nfrom these four clinical trials is not clear.A search of the PDQ clinical trials database indicates that no\\nclinical trials of hydrazine sulfate as a therapy for cancer are being\\nconducted at this time.Studies of Hydrazine Sulfate in Which\\nTherapeutic Benefit Was AssessedaReference Citation(s)Type of StudyType of Cancer           No. of Patients: Enrolled; Treated; ControlbStrongest Benefit ReportedcConcurrent TherapydLevel\\nof Evidence ScoreeNo.  = number.aSee text for more details.bNumber of patients treated plus number of control patients  may not equal number of patients enrolled; number of patients enrolled = number of patients initially recruited/considered by the researchers who conducted a study; number of patients treated = number of enrolled patients who were given the treatment being studied AND for whom results were reported; historical control subjects are not included in number of patients enrolled.cThe strongest evidence reported that the treatment under study has\\nanticancer activity or otherwise improves the well-being of cancer patients.\\nSee text and glossary for definition of terms.dSurgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy given/allowed at the same\\ntime as hydrazine sulfate treatment.eFor information about levels of evidence analysis and an\\nexplanation of the level of evidence scores, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.fThis study included six additional patients with benign brain tumors.gInsufficient information given to permit a level of evidence analysis.[1]Randomized\\nclinical trial Advanced\\nnon-small\\ncell lung65;   32; 33, placeboNoneYes1iA[4,15]Randomized\\nclinical trial Advanced\\nnon-small\\ncell lung291;  135; 131, placeboNone Yes1iA[5]Randomized\\nclinical trialAdvanced\\ncolorectal128;    63;  64, placeboNone No1iA[6]Randomized\\nclinical trial   Advanced\\nnon-small\\ncell lung243; 119;  118, placeboNone Yes1iA [2]Nonconsecutive\\n case seriesVarious advanced25; 25; None Slight regression of some metastatic lesions, 1 patient with melanomaNo3iiiDiii[3]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesVarious advanced 158; 84; None Measurable tumor regression, 7 patients Yes3iiiDiii[7,9,10]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesVarious\\nadvanced763; 740;  None Complete\\ntumor\\nregression,\\n 6 patientsNo3iiiDiii [8]Nonconsecutive\\ncase series Various\\nadvanced 25; 25;  NoneNone No3iiiDiii[11]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesVarious\\nadvanced  32; 29; None None Unknown3iiiDiii[12]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesVarious\\nadvanced101; 71; 30, placeboImproved\\nweight\\nmaintenance\\nor gain,\\n 41 hydrazine\\nsulfate treated vs. 17 placebo-treated\\npatients Yes3iiiDiii[18]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesGlioblastoma,\\nastrocytoma, or\\nmeningiomaf465;   46; NoneImproved\\nsurvival,\\n patients\\nwith\\nglioblastoma YesNonegReferencesChlebowski RT, Bulcavage L, Grosvenor M, et al.: Hydrazine sulfate influence on nutritional status and survival in non-small-cell lung cancer.

After 4 months he presented with evidence of renal and liver toxicity,  which eventually resulted in death.  This case highlights the danger of accessing materials and medical information on the Internet and proceeding with self-medication without seeking proper medical advice and supervision.[15]The side effects of hydrazine sulfate have been described as\\nmild to moderate in severity, and their incidence appears to have been low. \\nMost side effects are reported to resolve when treatment is stopped.  However,\\nlimited evidence from animal studies suggests that hydrazine sulfate is\\nhighly toxic when combined with either alcohol or barbiturates.[16-19]ReferencesSpremulli E, Wampler GL, Regelson W: Clinical study of hydrazine sulfate in advanced cancer patients.

Last accessed April 11, 2016.\\n\\n\\nSummary of the Evidence for Hydrazine Sulfate\\n Several clinical case series conducted by Russian investigators have indicated that hydrazine sulfate has marginal anticancer activity, but these results are considered inconclusive due to the lack of control groups and insufficient information provided about study methodology. Well-controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States have shown no evidence of anticancer activity.  In addition, evidence concerning  the effectiveness of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment\\nfor cancer-related cachexia and anorexia is inconclusive. Furthermore,\\nhydrazine sulfate has been shown to increase the incidence of several types of\\ntumors in animals, and it has been classified as a potential carcinogen by the\\nNational Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human\\nServices. The use of hydrazine sulfate as an anticancer drug outside the context of clinical trials\\nhas not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration   and, thus, cannot be recommended.Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., endpoints) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score.       For additional information about levels of evidence analysis, refer to Levels of Evidence  for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.\\n\\n\\nLatest Updates to This Summary (08/23/2018)\\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as\\nnew information becomes available.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of ovarian low-malignant potential tumors.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.Reviewers and UpdatesEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board.\\nClinical Trial InformationA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI\\'s website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI\\'s contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).\\nPermission to Use This SummaryPDQ is a registered trademark.

You can help your child by keeping her\\xa0life as normal as possible.\\nCredit: iStock\\n\\nA cancer diagnosis is upsetting at any age, but especially so when the patient is a child. It\\'s natural to have many questions, such as, Who should treat my child? Will my child get well? What does all of this mean for our family? Not all questions have answers, but the information and resources on this page provide a starting point for understanding the basics of childhood cancer.\\n\\n\\nOn This Page\\n\\nTypes of Cancer in Children\\n\\n\\nTreating Childhood Cancer\\n\\n\\nWhere Children with Cancer Are Treated\\n\\n\\nCoping with Cancer\\n\\n\\nSurvivorship\\n\\n\\nCauses of Childhood Cancer\\n\\n\\nResearch\\n\\n\\nTypes of Cancer in Children\\n\\nIn the United States in 2023, an estimated 9,910 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed among children from birth to 14 years, and\\xa0about 1,040 children\\xa0are expected to\\xa0die from the disease. Although\\xa0cancer death rates for this age group have declined by 70 percent from 1970 through 2020, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease among children. The most common types of cancer diagnosed in children ages 0 to 14 years are leukemias, brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tumors, and lymphomas.\\nNCI’s Cancer Stat Facts include detailed cancer rate and trend information for certain types of childhood cancer.\\xa0\\n\\nTreating Childhood Cancer\\nChildren\\'s cancers are not always treated like adult cancers. Pediatric oncology is a medical specialty focused on the care of children with cancer. It\\'s important to know that this expertise exists and that there are effective treatments for many childhood cancers.\\xa0\\n \\n\\nTreatment Considerations for Children with Cancer\\n\\n\\nPediatric oncology experts and parents discuss childhood cancer treatment-related decisions, side effects, clinical trials for children with cancer, and strategies to care for children at home.\\n\\nAccess an audio described version\\xa0of the\\xa0video\\nTypes of Treatment\\nThere are many types of cancer treatment. The types of treatment that a child with cancer receives will depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. Common treatments include: surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and stem cell transplant. Learn about these and other therapies in our Types of Treatment section.\\n\\nThe Latest Expert-Reviewed Information\\nNCI’s PDQ® pediatric treatment cancer information summaries explain diagnosis, staging, and treatment options for children\\'s cancers.\\nOur summary about Childhood Cancer Genomics describes the genomic alterations associated with different pediatric cancers, and their significance for therapy and prognosis.\\n\\nClinical Trials\\n\\n \\nNCI-COG Pediatric MATCH\\nThis trial is studying treatments targeted to tumor alterations in children and adolescents with advanced cancer.\\n\\nBefore any new treatment can be made widely available to patients, it must be studied in clinical trials (research studies) and found to be safe and effective in treating disease. Clinical trials for children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to compare potentially better therapy with therapy that is currently accepted as standard. Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.\\nOur site\\'s Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers explains how clinical trials work. Information specialists who staff NCI’s Cancer Information Service can answer questions about the process and help identify ongoing clinical trials for children with cancer.\\nTreatment Side Effects\\nChildren face unique issues during their treatment for cancer, after the completion of treatment, and as survivors of cancer. For example, they may receive more intense treatments, cancer and its treatments have different effects on growing bodies than adult bodies, and they may respond differently to drugs that control symptoms in adults. Late effects of treatment are discussed later on this page in the Survivorship section.\\n\\nWhere Children with Cancer Are Treated\\nChildren who have cancer are often treated at a children’s cancer center, which is a hospital or unit in a hospital that specializes in treating children with cancer.\\xa0\\nThe doctors and other health professionals at these centers have special training and expertise to give complete care to children. Specialists at a children’s cancer center are likely to include primary care physicians, pediatric oncologists/hematologists, pediatric surgical specialists, radiation oncologists, rehabilitation specialists, pediatric nurse specialists, social workers, and psychologists. At these centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer that occur in children, and the opportunity to participate in a trial is offered to many patients.\\nHospitals that have experts in treating children with cancer are usually member institutions of the NCI-supported Children’s Oncology Group (COG). COG is the world’s largest organization that conducts clinical research to improve the care and treatment of children with cancer.\\xa0NCI\\'s Cancer Information Service\\xa0can help families find COG-affiliated hospitals.\\nAt the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, NCI’s Pediatric Oncology Branch cares for children and young adults with cancer. Health professionals and scientists conduct translational research that spans basic science to clinical trials to improve outcomes for children and young adults with cancer and genetic tumor predisposition syndromes.\\n\\nCoping with Cancer\\nAdjusting to a child’s cancer diagnosis and finding ways to stay strong is challenging for everyone in a family. Our page, Support for Families When a\\xa0Child\\xa0Has Cancer, has tips for talking with children about their cancer and preparing them for changes they may experience. Also included are ways to help brothers and sisters cope, steps parents can take when they need support, and tips for working with the health care team. Various aspects of coping and support are also discussed in the publication Children with Cancer: A Guide for Parents.\\n\\nSurvivorship\\n\\n\\nIt’s essential for childhood cancer survivors to receive follow-up care to monitor their health after completing treatment. All survivors should have a treatment summary and a survivorship care plan, as discussed on our Care for Childhood Cancer Survivors page. That page also has information on clinics that specialize in providing follow-up care for people who have had childhood cancer.\\nSurvivors of any kind of cancer can develop health problems months or years after cancer treatment, known as late effects, but late effects are of particular concern for childhood cancer survivors because treatment of children can lead to profound, lasting physical and emotional effects. Late effects vary with the type of cancer, the child’s age, the type of treatment, and other factors. Information on types of late effects and ways to manage these can be found on our Care for Childhood Cancer Survivors page.\\xa0The PDQ® Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer summary has\\xa0in-depth information.\\nSurvivorship care and adjustments that both\\xa0parents and\\xa0children may go through\\xa0are also discussed in the publication\\xa0Children with Cancer: A Guide for Parents.\\n\\nCauses of Childhood Cancer\\nThe causes of most childhood cancers are not known. About 8 to 10 percent of all cancers in children are caused by an inherited mutation (a genetic mutation that can be passed from parents to their children).\\nMost cancers in children, like those in adults, are thought to develop as a result of mutations in genes that lead to uncontrolled cell growth and eventually cancer. In adults, these gene mutations reflect the cumulative effects of aging and long-term exposure to cancer-causing substances. However, identifying potential environmental causes of childhood cancer has been difficult, partly because cancer in children is rare and partly because it is difficult to determine what children might have been exposed to early in their development. More information about possible causes of cancer in children is available in the fact sheet, Cancer in Children and Adolescents.\\n\\nResearch\\nNCI supports a broad range of research to better understand the causes, biology, and patterns of childhood cancers and to identify the best ways to successfully treat children with cancer. In the context of clinical trials, researchers are treating and learning from young cancer patients. Researchers are also following childhood cancer survivors to learn about health and other issues they may face as a result of their cancer treatment.

relationship between pregnancy and breast cancer risk?\\n\\n\\nStudies have shown that a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer is related to her exposure to hormones that are produced by her ovaries (endogenous estrogen and progesterone). Reproductive factors that increase the duration and/or levels of exposure to ovarian hormones, which stimulate cell growth, have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. These factors include early onset of menstruation, late onset of menopause, and factors that may allow breast tissue to be exposed to high levels of hormones for longer periods of time, such as later age at first pregnancy and never having given birth.\\nConversely, pregnancy and breastfeeding, which both reduce a woman’s lifetime number of menstrual cycles, and thus her cumulative exposure to endogenous hormones (1), are associated with a decrease in breast cancer risk. In addition, pregnancy and breastfeeding have direct effects on breast cells, causing them to differentiate, or mature, so they can produce milk. Some researchers hypothesize that these differentiated cells are more resistant to becoming transformed into cancer cells than cells that have not undergone differentiation (2, 3).\\n\\nAre any pregnancy-related factors associated with a lower risk of breast cancer?', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Barani\\\\Desktop\\\\local_ollama\\\\html\\\\cancer_gov_pages.html', 'title': 'Comprehensive Cancer Information - NCI'}),\n",

Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.\\n\\nOn This Page\\n\\nTypes of treatment\\nTreatment of localized liver cancer\\nTreatment of locally advanced or metastatic liver cancer\\nTreatment of recurrent liver cancer\\n\\n\\nTypes of treatment\\nSurveillanceSurveillance is used for lesions smaller than 1 centimeter found during screening. Follow-up every 3 months is common. Surveillance is closely watching a patient's condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule.SurgeryA partial hepatectomy (surgery to remove the part of the liver where cancer is found) may be done. A wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with some of the healthy tissue around  it is removed. The remaining liver tissue takes over the functions of the liver and may regrow.Liver transplantIn a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed and replaced with a healthy donated liver. A liver transplant may be done when the disease is in the liver only and a donated liver can be found. If the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed.Ablation therapyAblation therapy removes or destroys tissue. Different types of ablation therapy are used for liver cancer:Radiofrequency ablation: Special needles are inserted directly through the skin or through an incision in the abdomen to reach the tumor. High-energy radio waves heat the needles and tumor which kills cancer cells.Microwave therapy: The tumor is exposed to high temperatures created by microwaves. This can damage and kill cancer cells or make them more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs.Percutaneous ethanol injection: A small needle is used to inject ethanol (pure alcohol) directly into a tumor to kill cancer cells. Several treatments may be needed. Usually local anesthesia is used, but if the patient has many tumors in the liver, general anesthesia may be used.Cryoablation: An instrument is used to freeze and destroy cancer cells. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy and cryosurgery. The doctor may use ultrasound to guide the instrument. To learn more, see Cryosurgery to Treat Cancer.Electroporation therapy: Electrical pulses are sent through an electrode placed in a tumor to kill cancer cells. Electroporation therapy is being studied in clinical trials.Embolization therapyEmbolization therapy is used for patients who cannot have surgery to remove the tumor or ablation therapy and whose tumor has not spread outside the liver. Embolization therapy is the use of substances to block or decrease the flow of blood through the hepatic artery to the tumor. When the tumor does not get the oxygen and nutrients it needs, it will not continue to grow.The liver receives blood from the hepatic portal vein and the hepatic artery. Blood that comes into the liver from the hepatic portal vein usually goes to the healthy liver tissue. Blood that comes from the hepatic artery usually goes to the tumor. When the hepatic artery is blocked during embolization therapy, the healthy liver tissue continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein.There are two main types of embolization therapy:Transarterial embolization (TAE): A small incision (cut) is made in the inner thigh and a catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted and threaded up into the hepatic artery. Once the catheter is in place, a substance that blocks the hepatic artery and stops blood flow to the tumor is injected.Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): This procedure is like TAE except an anticancer drug is also given. The procedure can be done by attaching the anticancer drug to small beads that are injected into the hepatic artery or by injecting the anticancer drug through the catheter into the hepatic artery and then injecting the substance to block the hepatic artery. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. This type of treatment is also called chemoembolization.Targeted therapyTargeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies used to treat advanced liver cancer include the following:bevacizumabcabozantiniblenvatinibramucirumabregorafenibsorafenibTo learn more about targeted therapy and its side effects, see Targeted Therapy to Treat Cancer.ImmunotherapyImmunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a type of immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors that may be used to treat liver cancer include the following:atezolizumab with the targeted therapy bevacizumabnivolumab with ipilimumabpembrolizumabdurvalumab with tremelimumabTo learn more about immunotherapy and its side effects, see Immunotherapy to Treat Cancer and Immunotherapy Side Effects.Radiation therapyExternal radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Radiation is given in a series of treatments to allow healthy cells to recover and to make radiation more effective. The number of treatments is based on details about the cancer, such as the size and location of the tumor. Certain ways of giving external radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue:Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional, or 3-D, picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor.To learn more about radiation therapy and its side effects, see Radiation Therapy to Treat Cancer and Radiation Therapy Side Effects.Clinical trialsA treatment clinical trial is a\\u202fresearch study\\u202fmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\\u202fcancer.\\u202fFor some patients, taking part in a\\u202fclinical trial\\u202fmay be an option.Use our\\u202fclinical trial search\\u202fto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

Reproductive factors that increase the duration and/or levels of exposure to ovarian hormones, which stimulate cell growth, have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. These factors include early onset of menstruation, late onset of menopause, and factors that may allow breast tissue to be exposed to high levels of hormones for longer periods of time, such as later age at first pregnancy and never having given birth.\\nConversely, pregnancy and breastfeeding, which both reduce a woman’s lifetime number of menstrual cycles, and thus her cumulative exposure to endogenous hormones (1), are associated with a decrease in breast cancer risk. In addition, pregnancy and breastfeeding have direct effects on breast cells, causing them to differentiate, or mature, so they can produce milk. Some researchers hypothesize that these differentiated cells are more resistant to becoming transformed into cancer cells than cells that have not undergone differentiation (2, 3).\\n\\nAre any pregnancy-related factors associated with a lower risk of breast cancer?\\n\\n\\nSome pregnancy-related factors have been associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer later in life. These factors include:\\nEarly age at first full-term pregnancy. Women who have their first full-term pregnancy at an early age have a decreased risk of developing breast cancer later in life. For example, in women who have a first full-term pregnancy before age 20, the risk of developing breast cancer is about half that of women whose first full-term pregnancy occurs after the age of 30 (4). This risk reduction is limited to hormone receptor–positive breast cancer; age at first full-term pregnancy does not appear to affect the risk of hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (5, 6).\\nIncreasing number of births. The risk of breast cancer declines with the number of children borne. Women who have given birth to five or more children have half the breast cancer risk of women who have not given birth (7). Some evidence indicates that the reduced risk associated with a higher number of births may be limited to hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.\\nHistory of preeclampsia. Women who have had preeclampsia may have a decreased risk of developing breast cancer (8–11). Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy in which a woman develops high blood pressure and excess amounts of protein in her urine. Scientists are studying whether certain hormones and proteins associated with preeclampsia may affect breast cancer risk (8, 12, 13).\\nLonger duration of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding for an extended period (at least a year) is associated with decreased risks of both hormone receptor–positive and hormone receptor–negative breast cancers (6, 14).\\n\\n\\nAre any pregnancy-related factors associated with an increase in breast cancer risk?\\n\\n\\nSome factors related to pregnancy may increase the risk of breast cancer. These factors include:\\nOlder age at birth of first child. The older a woman is when she has her first full-term pregnancy, the higher her risk of breast cancer. Women who are older than 30 when they give birth to their first child have a higher risk of breast cancer than women who have never given birth (15).\\nRecent childbirth. Women who have recently given birth have a short-term increase in breast cancer risk that declines after about 10 years. The reason for this temporary increase is not known, but some researchers believe that it may be due to the effect of high levels of hormones on the development of cancers or to the rapid growth of breast cells during pregnancy (16).\\nTaking diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy. DES is a synthetic form of estrogen that was used between the early 1940s and 1971 to prevent miscarriages and other pregnancy problems. Women who took DES during pregnancy may have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer than women who did not take DES during pregnancy (17). Some studies have shown that daughters of women who took DES during pregnancy may also have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer after age 40 than women who were not exposed to DES while in the womb (18), but the evidence is inconsistent (19).\\n\\n\\nIs abortion linked to breast cancer risk?\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Barani\\\\Desktop\\\\local_ollama\\\\html\\\\cancer_gov_pages.html', 'title': 'Comprehensive Cancer Information - NCI'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Latest Updates to This Summary (03/08/2024)\\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available.  This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)Updated statistics with estimated new cases and deaths for 2024 (cited American Cancer Society as reference 1).Updated statistics with new 5-year relative survival rates for 2013 to 2019.Treatment of Stages IA and IB NSCLCRevised the list of treatment options for stages IA and IB NSCLC to include adjuvant immunotherapy.Added text about the results of a multicenter, noninferiority, phase III trial of lobar or sublobar resection in patients with peripheral stage IA NSCLC  after intraoperative confirmation of node-negative disease in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes (cited Altorki et al. as reference 5 and level of evidence B1).

abortion linked to breast cancer risk?\\n\\n\\nDoes pregnancy affect the risk of other cancers?\\n\\n\\nDoes fertility treatment affect the risk of breast or other cancers?\\n\\n\\nIs there a relationship between pregnancy and breast cancer risk?\\n\\n\\nStudies have shown that a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer is related to her exposure to hormones that are produced by her ovaries (endogenous estrogen and progesterone). Reproductive factors that increase the duration and/or levels of exposure to ovarian hormones, which stimulate cell growth, have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. These factors include early onset of menstruation, late onset of menopause, and factors that may allow breast tissue to be exposed to high levels of hormones for longer periods of time, such as later age at first pregnancy and never having given birth.\\nConversely, pregnancy and breastfeeding, which both reduce a woman’s lifetime number of menstrual cycles, and thus her cumulative exposure to endogenous hormones (1), are associated with a decrease in breast cancer risk. In addition, pregnancy and breastfeeding have direct effects on breast cells, causing them to differentiate, or mature, so they can produce milk. Some researchers hypothesize that these differentiated cells are more resistant to becoming transformed into cancer cells than cells that have not undergone differentiation (2, 3).\\n\\nAre any pregnancy-related factors associated with a lower risk of breast cancer?\\n\\n\\nSome pregnancy-related factors have been associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer later in life. These factors include:\\nEarly age at first full-term pregnancy. Women who have their first full-term pregnancy at an early age have a decreased risk of developing breast cancer later in life. For example, in women who have a first full-term pregnancy before age 20, the risk of developing breast cancer is about half that of women whose first full-term pregnancy occurs after the age of 30 (4). This risk reduction is limited to hormone receptor–positive breast cancer; age at first full-term pregnancy does not appear to affect the risk of hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (5, 6).\\nIncreasing number of births. The risk of breast cancer declines with the number of children borne. Women who have given birth to five or more children have half the breast cancer risk of women who have not given birth (7). Some evidence indicates that the reduced risk associated with a higher number of births may be limited to hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.\\nHistory of preeclampsia. Women who have had preeclampsia may have a decreased risk of developing breast cancer (8–11). Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy in which a woman develops high blood pressure and excess amounts of protein in her urine. Scientists are studying whether certain hormones and proteins associated with preeclampsia may affect breast cancer risk (8, 12, 13).\\nLonger duration of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding for an extended period (at least a year) is associated with decreased risks of both hormone receptor–positive and hormone receptor–negative breast cancers (6, 14).\\n\\n\\nAre any pregnancy-related factors associated with an increase in breast cancer risk?\\n\\n\\nSome factors related to pregnancy may increase the risk of breast cancer. These factors include:\\nOlder age at birth of first child. The older a woman is when she has her first full-term pregnancy, the higher her risk of breast cancer. Women who are older than 30 when they give birth to their first child have a higher risk of breast cancer than women who have never given birth (15).\\nRecent childbirth. Women who have recently given birth have a short-term increase in breast cancer risk that declines after about 10 years. The reason for this temporary increase is not known, but some researchers believe that it may be due to the effect of high levels of hormones on the development of cancers or to the rapid growth of breast cells during pregnancy (16).\\nTaking diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy. DES is a synthetic form of estrogen that was used between the early 1940s and 1971 to prevent miscarriages and other pregnancy problems. Women who took DES during pregnancy may have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer than women who did not take DES during pregnancy (17). Some studies have shown that daughters of women who took DES during pregnancy may also have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer after age 40 than women who were not exposed to DES while in the womb (18), but the evidence is inconsistent (19).\\n\\n\\nIs abortion linked to breast cancer risk?\\n\\n\\nA few retrospective (case-control) studies reported in the mid-1990s suggested that induced abortion (the deliberate ending of a pregnancy) was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. However, these studies had important design limitations that could have affected the results. A key limitation was their reliance on self-reporting of medical history information by the study participants, which can introduce bias. Prospective studies, which are more rigorous in design and unaffected by such bias, have consistently shown no association between induced abortion and breast cancer risk (20–25). Moreover, in 2009, the Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concluded that “more rigorous recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk” (26). Major findings from these studies include:\\nWomen who have had an induced abortion have the same risk of breast cancer as other women.\\nWomen who have had a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) have the same risk of breast cancer as other women.\\nCancers other than breast cancer also appear to be unrelated to a history of induced or spontaneous abortion.\\n\\n\\nDoes pregnancy affect the risk of other cancers?\\n\\n\\nResearch has shown the following with regard to pregnancy and the risk of other cancers:\\nWomen who have had a full-term pregnancy have reduced risks of ovarian (27, 28) and endometrial (29) cancers. Furthermore, the risks of these cancers decline with each additional full-term pregnancy.\\nPregnancy also plays a role in an extremely rare type of tumor called a gestational trophoblastic tumor. In this type of tumor, which starts in the uterus, cancer cells grow in the tissues that are formed following conception.\\nThere is some evidence that pregnancy-related factors may affect the risk of other cancer types, but these relationships have not been as well studied as those for breast and gynecologic cancers. The associations require further study to clarify the exact relationships.\\nAs in the development of breast cancer, exposures to hormones are thought to explain the role of pregnancy in the development of ovarian, endometrial, and other cancers. Changes in the levels of hormones during pregnancy may contribute to the variation in risk of these tumors after pregnancy (30).\\n\\nDoes fertility treatment affect the risk of breast or other cancers?\\n\\n\\nWomen who have difficulty becoming pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term may receive fertility treatment. Such treatment can include surgery (to repair diseased, damaged, or blocked fallopian tubes or to remove uterine fibroids, patches of endometriosis, or adhesions); medications to stimulate ovulation; and assisted reproductive technology.\\nOvarian stimulation and some assisted reproductive technologies involve treatments that temporarily change the levels of estrogen and progesterone in a woman’s body. For example, women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) receive multiple rounds of hormone treatment to first suppress ovulation until the developing eggs are ready, then stimulate development of multiple eggs, and finally promote maturation of the eggs. The use of hormones in some fertility treatments has raised concerns about possible increased risks of cancer, particularly cancers that are linked to elevated levels of these hormones.\\nMany studies have examined possible associations between use of fertility drugs or IVF and the risks of breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. The results of such studies can be hard to interpret because infertility itself is linked to increased risks of these cancers (that is, compared with fertile women, infertile women are at higher risk of these cancers even if they do not use fertility drugs). Also, these cancers are relatively rare and tend to develop years after treatment for infertility, which can make it difficult to link their occurrence to past use of fertility drugs.\\nBreast cancer: The bulk of the evidence is consistent with no increased risk of breast cancer associated with the use of fertility drugs or IVF (31–34).\\xa0\\nOvarian cancer: There is some uncertainty about whether treatment for infertility is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. A 2013 systematic review of 25 studies that included more than 180,000 women found, overall, no strong evidence of an increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer for women treated with fertility drugs (35). In one study, women who underwent IVF had an increase in risk of ovarian borderline malignant tumors (36).\\nEndometrial cancer: Overall, the use of fertility drugs or IVF does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer (34).\\n\\n              Selected References          \\n\\n\\nColditz GA, Baer HJ, Tamimi RM.

      "\n",
      "\"Studies have shown that a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer is related to her exposure to hormones that are produced by her ovaries (endogenous estrogen and progesterone). Reproductive factors that increase the duration and/or levels of exposure to ovarian hormones, which stimulate cell growth, have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. These factors include early onset of menstruation, late onset of menopause, and factors that may allow breast tissue to be exposed to high levels of hormones for longer periods of time, such as later age at first pregnancy and never having given birth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Conversely, pregnancy and breastfeeding, which both reduce a woman’s lifetime number of menstrual cycles, and thus her cumulative exposure to endogenous hormones, are associated with a decrease in breast cancer risk. In addition, pregnancy and breastfeeding have direct effects on breast cells, causing them to differentiate, or mature, so they can produce milk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some pregnancy-related factors have been associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer later in life. These factors include: Early age at first full-term pregnancy. Women who have their first full-term pregnancy at an early age have a decreased risk of developing breast cancer later in life. Increasing number of births. The risk of breast cancer declines with the number of children borne. History of preeclampsia. Women who have had preeclampsia may have a decreased risk of developing breast cancer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some factors related to pregnancy may increase the risk of breast cancer. These factors include: Older age at birth of first child. The older a woman is when she has her first full-term pregnancy, the higher her risk of breast cancer. Recent childbirth. Women who have recently given birth have a short-term increase in breast cancer risk that declines after about 10 years.\"\n",

      " page_content=\"Human/Clinical Studies\\nMost of the information presented here is summarized in a\\ntable located at the end of this section. Hydrazine sulfate has been studied extensively in patients with advanced\\ncancer.  These studies have evaluated the following: a) tumor response and/or\\nsurvival among patients with various types of cancer,[1-13] b)\\nchanges in body weight,[1-6,8,10-12,14] c) carefully measured\\nquality of life,[4-6,15] and d)\\nchanges in nutritional or metabolic\\nstatus.[1,4,12,13,16,17]  Clinical studies of hydrazine sulfate have been\\nfunded by a pharmaceutical company,[3] the Russian government,[7,9,10,18]\\nand by grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI).[1,2,4-6,8,11,12,15,16]  They have also been\\nsponsored by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) [5,6] and the\\nCancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).[4,15] The first clinical tests of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for cancer\\nwere conducted in the mid-1970s by a pharmaceutical company.[3]  In an uncontrolled study of 158\\npatients with advanced disease, it was found that 45 of 84 evaluable patients had\\nsubjective improvements (i.e., the patients reported an increase in appetite,\\na decrease in weight loss, an increase in strength, or a decrease in pain) and\\nthat 14 had objective improvements (i.e., there was measurable tumor regression, stable disease, or improvement in a\\ncancer-related disorder) in response to treatment with hydrazine sulfate. \\nAmong the patients with objective responses, two had long-term (17 and 18\\nmonths) stabilization of their disease and seven had measurable tumor\\nregression, although the extent and duration of these  regressions were not\\nspecified.  Major weaknesses of this study included the absence of a control\\n(i.e., comparison) group and the fact that 74 of the 158 initially recruited\\npatients could not be evaluated because of poor prognosis, missing documentation,\\ninsufficient duration of treatment, and/or concurrent therapy (i.e.,\\ntherapy given at the same time) with other anticancer drugs.[3]In 1976, Russian investigators reported findings from 95 patients with\\nadvanced cancer who had been treated with hydrazine sulfate after all previous\\ntherapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) had\\nfailed.[9]  Three partial responses (i.e.,\\nreductions in tumor size of greater than 50% observed for a period of 4 weeks\\nor more) and no complete responses were noted\\nafter 1 to 5 months of treatment.  Tumor regressions of 50% or less and stable\\ndisease (i.e., cessation of tumor growth for a period of 1.5 to 2.0 months or\\nmore) were reported for 16 and 20 patients, respectively.In 1981, the same investigators published findings from 225 patients with\\nadvanced disease who had been treated with hydrazine sulfate after all\\nprevious therapy had failed.[10] It appears that the 225 patients described in\\nthis second report [10] included the 95 patients described in the first\\nreport.[9]  Partial responses and stable disease were reported for 4 and\\n95 patients, respectively, after 1 to 6 months of treatment.  No patient\\nexperienced a complete response.  Subjective improvements in appetite, weight\\nstabilization or gain, pain, fever, breathing, and/or mental outlook were\\nreported by 147 patients.In 1995, the same Russian investigators published findings from 740\\npatients with advanced cancer.[7]  Once again, it appears that 225 of these\\n740 patients were described in the earlier reports.[9,10]  Partial responses\\nand stable disease were reported for 25 and 263 patients, respectively. \\nComplete responses were noted for six patients.  Subjective improvements in\\ncancer-related symptoms were reported by\\n344 patients.In 1994, the same investigators reported findings from a clinical series involving 46\\npatients with malignant brain tumors\\n(38 with glioblastomas, four with\\nastrocytomas, and four with meningiomas) and six patients with benign brain tumors.[18]  These patients\\nwere not described in the other reports.[7,9,10]  All patients in this\\nseries appear to have been treated with surgery in addition to hydrazine\\nsulfate therapy, and at least some of the patients were also treated with\\nradiation therapy.  Complete or partial regression of neurologic  symptoms (e.g., seizures,\\nheadaches, sensory and motor disorders, and hallucinations) was\\nreported for 73% of the patients.  In addition, longer-than-average survival\\nwas reported for most patients.  Among the patients with glioblastomas, the\\nincrease in average survival time was from 6 months to more than 13\\nmonths.[18]Evaluation of the findings from these Russian clinical series [7,9,10,18]\\nis made difficult by the limited information provided about the patients and\\ntheir treatment histories.  In addition, insufficient information was given\\nabout study design and methodology.  The absence of control groups; the\\nreceipt of prior or concurrent surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy\\nby all patients; and the reliance on subjective measures of  quality of life\\nare major study weaknesses.  Therefore, it is difficult to ascribe any of the\\npositive findings to treatment with hydrazine sulfate. In contrast with the\\npreviously described clinical series, three NCI-funded clinical series found\\nno complete responses or partial responses among a total of 79 patients\\ntreated with hydrazine sulfate.[2,8,11] In addition, only temporary, minor\\nimprovements in appetite, pain, and weight stabilization or gain were reported\\nby the patients in these series. A weakness in these three clinical series was\\nthe absence of control groups.Findings from four placebo-controlled, randomized clinical\\ntrials, however, also fail to support the effectiveness of hydrazine sulfate\\nas a cancer treatment in humans.[1,4-6,15]  In these trials,\\nsurvival,[1,4-6,15] objective tumor response,[1,4,15] and carefully measured\\nquality of life [4-6,15] were major endpoints. One of the trials involved 65 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and examined the effects of hydrazine sulfate\\non survival and nutritional status.[1]  In this trial, patients received\\neither hydrazine sulfate or placebo in addition to a multiple-drug\\nchemotherapy regimen.  When all patients were evaluated, no improvement in\\nsurvival was found with hydrazine sulfate therapy.  In addition, no\\ndifferences were noted in objective tumor response between the hydrazine\\nsulfate group and the placebo group.  However, on the basis of caloric intake and the maintenance\\nof serum albumin levels, the\\nnutritional status of the patients in the hydrazine sulfate group was judged\\nbetter than that of the patients in the placebo group.  However, the moderate\\nincreases in body weight associated with hydrazine sulfate use did not achieve\\nstatistical significance.A CALGB-sponsored trial also evaluated the use of hydrazine sulfate as a\\ntreatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.[4,15]  In\\nthis trial, 266 patients received either hydrazine sulfate or placebo in\\naddition to a multiple-drug chemotherapy regimen.  No differences in survival,\\nobjective tumor response, anorexia, weight gain or loss, or nutritional status\\nwere observed between the hydrazine sulfate group and the placebo group. \\nHowever, the quality of life of the patients who received hydrazine sulfate\\nwas found to be statistically significantly worse than that of the patients\\nwho received placebo.The use of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for patients with non-small\\ncell lung cancer was also evaluated in an NCCTG-sponsored trial.[6]  In this\\ntrial, 243 patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrazine sulfate\\nor placebo in addition to a multiple-drug chemotherapy regimen.  No\\nstatistically significant differences were found between the hydrazine sulfate\\ngroup and the placebo group with respect to either survival or \\nquality of life.Another NCCTG-sponsored trial tested hydrazine sulfate alone versus\\nplacebo in the treatment of 127 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.[5]  In this trial,\\nthe patients who received hydrazine sulfate had, on average, shorter survival\\nthan the patients who received placebo, a finding that was statistically\\nsignificant.  There were no statistically significant differences between the\\nhydrazine sulfate group and the placebo group with respect to weight gain or\\nloss, anorexia, or quality of life.Four other clinical trials did find some objective evidence of benefit with\\nhydrazine sulfate therapy.[12,13,16,17]  These trials had either nutritional\\nstatus or metabolic status as the primary endpoint.  In a placebo-controlled,\\nrandomized trial involving 38 patients with advanced disease, hydrazine\\nsulfate was found to improve the abnormal glucose metabolism seen in cancer patients.[13] \\nIn another placebo-controlled, randomized trial that involved 101 patients\\nwith advanced cancer and weight loss, the use of hydrazine sulfate was\\nassociated with statistically significant improvements in appetite and either\\nweight increase or weight maintenance.[12]  However, the higher average\\ncaloric intake observed in this study for patients treated with hydrazine\\nsulfate compared with patients treated with placebo was not statistically\\nsignificant.[12]  Two other clinical studies involving a total of 34 patients\\nwith either lung cancer or colon cancer found that hydrazine sulfate was able\\nto reduce the body protein breakdown associated with cancer cachexia.[16,17] \\nIn view of the totality of evidence, the overall importance of the findings\\nfrom these four clinical trials is not clear.A search of the PDQ clinical trials database indicates that no\\nclinical trials of hydrazine sulfate as a therapy for cancer are being\\nconducted at this time.Studies of Hydrazine Sulfate in Which\\nTherapeutic Benefit Was AssessedaReference Citation(s)Type of StudyType of Cancer           No. of Patients: Enrolled; Treated; ControlbStrongest Benefit ReportedcConcurrent TherapydLevel\\nof Evidence ScoreeNo.  = number.aSee text for more details.bNumber of patients treated plus number of control patients  may not equal number of patients enrolled; number of patients enrolled = number of patients initially recruited/considered by the researchers who conducted a study; number of patients treated = number of enrolled patients who were given the treatment being studied AND for whom results were reported; historical control subjects are not included in number of patients enrolled.cThe strongest evidence reported that the treatment under study has\\nanticancer activity or otherwise improves the well-being of cancer patients.\\nSee text and glossary for definition of terms.dSurgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy given/allowed at the same\\ntime as hydrazine sulfate treatment.eFor information about levels of evidence analysis and an\\nexplanation of the level of evidence scores, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.fThis study included six additional patients with benign brain tumors.gInsufficient information given to permit a level of evidence analysis.[1]Randomized\\nclinical trial Advanced\\nnon-small\\ncell lung65;   32; 33, placeboNoneYes1iA[4,15]Randomized\\nclinical trial Advanced\\nnon-small\\ncell lung291;  135; 131, placeboNone Yes1iA[5]Randomized\\nclinical trialAdvanced\\ncolorectal128;    63;  64, placeboNone No1iA[6]Randomized\\nclinical trial   Advanced\\nnon-small\\ncell lung243; 119;  118, placeboNone Yes1iA [2]Nonconsecutive\\n case seriesVarious advanced25; 25; None Slight regression of some metastatic lesions, 1 patient with melanomaNo3iiiDiii[3]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesVarious advanced 158; 84; None Measurable tumor regression, 7 patients Yes3iiiDiii[7,9,10]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesVarious\\nadvanced763; 740;  None Complete\\ntumor\\nregression,\\n 6 patientsNo3iiiDiii [8]Nonconsecutive\\ncase series Various\\nadvanced 25; 25;  NoneNone No3iiiDiii[11]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesVarious\\nadvanced  32; 29; None None Unknown3iiiDiii[12]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesVarious\\nadvanced101; 71; 30, placeboImproved\\nweight\\nmaintenance\\nor gain,\\n 41 hydrazine\\nsulfate treated vs. 17 placebo-treated\\npatients Yes3iiiDiii[18]Nonconsecutive\\ncase seriesGlioblastoma,\\nastrocytoma, or\\nmeningiomaf465;   46; NoneImproved\\nsurvival,\\n patients\\nwith\\nglioblastoma YesNonegReferencesChlebowski RT, Bulcavage L, Grosvenor M, et al.: Hydrazine sulfate influence on nutritional status and survival in non-small-cell lung cancer.

After 4 months he presented with evidence of renal and liver toxicity,  which eventually resulted in death.  This case highlights the danger of accessing materials and medical information on the Internet and proceeding with self-medication without seeking proper medical advice and supervision.[15]The side effects of hydrazine sulfate have been described as\\nmild to moderate in severity, and their incidence appears to have been low. \\nMost side effects are reported to resolve when treatment is stopped.  However,\\nlimited evidence from animal studies suggests that hydrazine sulfate is\\nhighly toxic when combined with either alcohol or barbiturates.[16-19]ReferencesSpremulli E, Wampler GL, Regelson W: Clinical study of hydrazine sulfate in advanced cancer patients.

Last accessed April 11, 2016.\\n\\n\\nSummary of the Evidence for Hydrazine Sulfate\\n Several clinical case series conducted by Russian investigators have indicated that hydrazine sulfate has marginal anticancer activity, but these results are considered inconclusive due to the lack of control groups and insufficient information provided about study methodology. Well-controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States have shown no evidence of anticancer activity.  In addition, evidence concerning  the effectiveness of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment\\nfor cancer-related cachexia and anorexia is inconclusive. Furthermore,\\nhydrazine sulfate has been shown to increase the incidence of several types of\\ntumors in animals, and it has been classified as a potential carcinogen by the\\nNational Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human\\nServices. The use of hydrazine sulfate as an anticancer drug outside the context of clinical trials\\nhas not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration   and, thus, cannot be recommended.Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., endpoints) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score.       For additional information about levels of evidence analysis, refer to Levels of Evidence  for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.\\n\\n\\nLatest Updates to This Summary (08/23/2018)\\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as\\nnew information becomes available.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the late effects of treatment for childhood cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.Reviewers and UpdatesEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board.\\nClinical Trial InformationA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI\\'s website.

Professional VersionKey PointsPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors   form in hormone-making cells (islet cells) of the pancreas.Pancreatic NETs      may or may not cause signs or symptoms.There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs. Having certain syndromes can increase the risk of pancreatic NETs. Different types of pancreatic NETs  have different signs and symptoms. \\n     Lab tests and imaging tests are used to diagnose pancreatic NETs. Other kinds of lab tests are used to check for the specific type of pancreatic NETs.Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors   form in hormone-making cells (islet cells) of the pancreas.The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine. EnlargeAnatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas has three areas: the head, body, and tail. It is found in the abdomen near the stomach, intestines, and other organs. There are two kinds  of cells in the pancreas:Endocrine pancreas cells make several kinds of hormones (chemicals that control the actions of certain cells or organs in the body), such as insulin to control blood sugar. They cluster together in many small groups (islets) throughout the pancreas. Endocrine pancreas cells are also called islet cells or islets of Langerhans. Tumors that form in islet cells are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs).   Exocrine pancreas cells make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food. Most of the pancreas is made of ducts with small sacs at the end of the ducts, which are lined with exocrine cells.  This summary discusses islet cell tumors of the endocrine pancreas.  See the PDQ summary on Pancreatic Cancer Treatment for information on exocrine pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). When pancreatic NETs are malignant, they are called pancreatic endocrine cancer or islet cell carcinoma.Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better prognosis.Pancreatic NETs      may or may not cause signs or symptoms.Pancreatic NETs may be functional or nonfunctional:Functional tumors make extra amounts of hormones, such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon, that cause signs and symptoms. Nonfunctional tumors do not make extra amounts of hormones. Signs and symptoms are caused by the tumor as it spreads and grows. \\n\\nMost nonfunctional tumors are malignant (cancer).Most pancreatic NETs are functional tumors.There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs. Pancreatic NETs make different kinds of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon. Functional pancreatic NETs  include the following:Gastrinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make gastrin. Gastrin is a hormone that causes the stomach to release an acid that helps digest  food. Both gastrin and stomach acid are increased by   gastrinomas. When increased stomach acid, stomach ulcers, and diarrhea  are caused by a tumor that makes gastrin, it is called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A gastrinoma usually  forms in the head of the pancreas and sometimes forms in the small intestine. Most gastrinomas are malignant (cancer).Insulinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. It moves glucose into the cells, where it can be used by the body for energy. Insulinomas are usually slow-growing tumors that rarely spread. An insulinoma forms in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas. Insulinomas are usually benign (not cancer).Glucagonoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that increases the amount of glucose in the blood. It causes the liver to break down glycogen. Too much glucagon causes hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). A glucagonoma usually forms in the tail of the pancreas. Most glucagonomas are malignant (cancer).Other types of tumors: There are other rare types of functional  pancreatic NETs  that make hormones, including hormones that control the balance of sugar, salt, and water in the body. These tumors include: VIPomas, which make vasoactive intestinal peptide. VIPoma may also be called Verner-Morrison syndrome.Somatostatinomas, which make somatostatin.These other types of tumors are grouped together because they are treated in much the same way.Having certain syndromes can increase the risk of pancreatic NETs. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called \\n         a risk factor.  Having a risk factor does not mean that you will \\n         get cancer; not having risk factors doesn\\'t mean that you will \\n         not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is a risk factor for pancreatic NETs.Different types of pancreatic NETs  have different signs and symptoms. \\n     Signs or symptoms can be caused by the growth of the tumor and/or by hormones the tumor makes or by other conditions. Some tumors may not cause signs or symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems. Signs and symptoms of a non-functional pancreatic NET\\nA non-functional pancreatic NET may grow for a long time without causing signs or symptoms. It may grow large or spread to other parts of the body before it causes signs or symptoms, such as:    Diarrhea.Indigestion.A lump in the abdomen.Pain in the abdomen or back.Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.Signs and symptoms of a functional pancreatic NET\\nThe signs and symptoms of a functional pancreatic NET depend on the type of hormone being made.' metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Barani\\\\Desktop\\\\local_ollama\\\\html\\\\cancer_gov_pages.html', 'title': 'Comprehensive Cancer Information - NCI'}\n"

      " Acupuncture is a component of traditional Chinese medicine that has been practiced for thousands of years. It involves the application of stimulation, such as needling, moxibustion, cupping, and acupressure, on specific sites of the body known as acupuncture points. Acupuncture is used to treat a wide range of illnesses and ailments, including those related to cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cancer patients use acupuncture for various reasons, such as pain management, control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (N/V), fatigue, hot flashes, xerostomia, neuropathy, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mechanisms of acupuncture for cancer treatment have been explored mainly through laboratory and animal studies, focusing on the role of acupuncture in activating neurohormonal pathways and immunomodulation. However, most clinical observations and trials have aimed to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on symptom management rather than curing cancer itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most convincing research data on the effects of acupuncture in cancer patients have emerged from studies of the management of chemotherapy-induced N/V. However, it is important to note that acupuncture should not be considered a cure for cancer but rather a complementary therapy used to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life during cancer treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer to your question is no, acupuncture cannot cure cancer. It can, however, be an effective tool in managing various symptoms and improving overall well-being for individuals undergoing cancer treatment.\n",

The most common sites where cancer spreads are\\xa0bone,\\xa0liver, and lung. The following list shows the most common sites of metastasis, not including the\\xa0lymph nodes, for some common cancers:\\nCommon Sites Where Cancer Spreads\\nCancer Type\\nMain Sites of Metastasis\\nBladder\\nBone, liver, lung\\nBreast\\nBone, brain, liver, lung\\nColon\\nLiver, lung, peritoneum\\nKidney\\nAdrenal gland, bone, brain, liver, lung\\nLung\\nAdrenal gland, bone, brain, liver, other lung\\nMelanoma\\nBone, brain, liver, lung, skin, muscle\\nOvary\\nLiver, lung, peritoneum\\nPancreas\\nLiver, lung, peritoneum\\nProstate\\nAdrenal gland, bone, liver, lung\\nRectal\\nLiver, lung, peritoneum\\nStomach\\nLiver, lung, peritoneum\\nThyroid\\nBone, liver, lung\\nUterus\\nBone, liver, lung, peritoneum, vagina\\nSymptoms of Metastatic Cancer\\nMetastatic cancer does not always cause symptoms. When symptoms do occur, what they are like and how often you have them will depend on the size and location of the metastatic tumors. Some common signs of metastatic cancer include:\\npain and fractures, when cancer has spread to the bone\\nheadache, seizures, or dizziness, when cancer has spread to the brain\\nshortness of breath, when cancer has spread to the lung\\njaundice or swelling in the belly, when cancer has spread to the liver\\nTreatment for Metastatic Cancer\\nThere are treatments for most types of metastatic cancer. Often, the goal of treating metastatic cancer is to control it by stopping or slowing its growth. Some people can live for years with metastatic cancer that is well controlled. Other treatments may improve the quality of life by relieving symptoms. This type of care is called palliative care. It can be given at any point during treatment for cancer.\\nThe treatment that you may have depends on your type of primary cancer, where it has spread, treatments you’ve had in the past, and your general health. To learn about treatment options, including clinical trials, find your type of cancer among the\\xa0PDQ® Cancer Information Summaries for Adult Treatment and Pediatric Treatment.\\nWhen Metastatic Cancer Can No Longer Be Controlled\\nIf you have been told your\\xa0cancer can no longer be controlled, you and your loved ones may want to discuss end-of-life care. Whether or not you choose to continue\\xa0treatment\\xa0to shrink the cancer or control its growth, you can always receive palliative care to control the symptoms of cancer and the side effects of treatment.

The summary includes a brief history of acupuncture practice, a review of laboratory and animal studies, the results of clinical observations and trials, and possible side effects of acupuncture therapy. Information presented in some sections of the summary can also be found in tables located at the end of those sections.This summary contains the following key information:As part of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture has been practiced in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years.Acupuncture is defined as the application of stimulation such as needling, moxibustion, cupping, and acupressure on specific sites of the body known as acupuncture points.Acupuncture has been practiced in the United States for about 200 years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the acupuncture needle as a medical device in 1996.Acupuncture is used to treat a wide range of illnesses and ailments. Cancer patients use it for pain management, control of nausea and  vomiting (N/V),  fatigue, hot flashes, xerostomia, neuropathy, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance.Laboratory and animal studies exploring the mechanisms of acupuncture for cancer treatment have focused mainly on the role of acupuncture in the activation of neurohormonal pathways and immunomodulation. The aim of most acupuncture clinical observation and clinical trials in cancer patients has been to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on symptom management.The most convincing research data on the effects of acupuncture in cancer patients have emerged from studies of the management of chemotherapy-induced N/V.Many of the medical and scientific terms used in this summary are hypertext linked (at first use in each section) to the NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms, which is oriented toward nonexperts. When a linked term is clicked, a definition will appear in a separate window.Reference citations in some PDQ cancer information summaries may include links to external websites that are operated by individuals or organizations for the purpose of marketing or advocating the use of specific treatments or products.

      " Aristolochic acids are compounds that have been linked to causing cancers in humans. Aristolochic acid is a natural compound found in some plants, including Aristolochia fangchi, which has been used traditionally in Chinese medicine for various purposes. However, long-term use of this herb has been associated with the development of kidney cancer and other health problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies have shown that aristolochic acid can cause DNA damage and mutations, leading to the development of cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified aristolochic acid as a Group 1 carcinogen, which is the highest risk category for substances that cause cancer in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aristolochic acid nephropathy (AN), a kidney disease caused by aristolochic acid exposure, is a well-documented health concern. AN can progress to kidney failure and renal carcinoma. Other types of cancer associated with aristolochic acid include urinary tract cancer, liver cancer, and bladder cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that the use of Aristolochia fangchi and other plants containing aristolochic acid is not recommended for medicinal purposes due to the potential risks. If you have concerns about herbal remedies or supplements, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before using them.\n",

      "changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About NeuroblastomaRevised text to state that the incidence is 8.3 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years. Also added text to state that the overall incidence of neuroblastoma cases in the United States has remained stable (cited Campbell et al. as reference 9).Added text about the epidemiological trends in incidence and outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma between 2003 and 2019 based on the United States Cancer Statistics database and the National Program of Cancer Registries survival database.Added text to state that with increased availability of sequencing techniques, the spectrum of germline alterations seen in patients with neuroblastoma is expanding. For example, one study identified a series of 11 patients with germline pathogenic variants in SMARCA4 (cited Witkowski et al. as reference 29). Also added text to state that BARD1, ERCC2, CHEK2, and MSH3 were the genes in which variants were most commonly observed. Variants in BARD1, EZH2, ALK, PTCH1, and MSH3 were specifically enriched in patients with neuroblastoma, compared with controls.Genomic and Biological Features of NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that next-generation sequencing or  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to identify TERT alterations. One study identified TERT rearrangements by FISH in 6% of all patients with neuroblastic tumors regardless of risk group and in 12.4% of patients with high-risk neuroblastic tumors (cited Yu et al. as reference 42).Stage Information for NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that one study of 50 children with neuroblastoma evaluated the role of gadolinium contrast as part of magnetic resonance imaging scans. Assessment of tumor size and image-defined risk factors appeared similar regardless of whether gadolinium was used (cited Morin et al. as reference 13).Treatment of High-Risk NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that these more favorable outcomes for patients with stage 4N disease were confirmed in a single-institution study of 51 patients (cited Kushner et al. as reference 5).Added text to state that an updated report describes the results of a propensity matching analysis that compared patients who were treated with eflornithine with patients in  the ANBL0032 trial who were not treated with eflornithine (cited Oesterheld et al. as reference 57). Propensity matching generally balanced differences in available patient characteristics. In the matched analysis, patients in the eflornithine cohort had statistically significantly higher event-free survival and overall survival, compared with patients in the non-eflornithine cohort. The authors note that uncontrolled confounders may exist in this nonrandomized comparison. Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of eflornithine as continuation therapy in December 2023.This summary is written and maintained by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is\n",

      "\n",
      "Computed tomography (CT) is a noninvasive imaging procedure that uses special x-ray equipment to create detailed pictures, or scans, of areas inside the body. \n",
      "Each picture created during a CT procedure shows the organs, bones, and other tissues in a thin “slice” of the body. The entire series of pictures produced in CT is like a loaf of sliced bread—you can look at each slice individually (2-dimensional pictures), or you can look at the whole loaf (a 3-dimensional picture). Computer programs are used to create both types of pictures.\n",
      "Modern CT machines take continuous pictures in a helical (or spiral) fashion rather than taking a series of pictures of individual slices of the body, as the original CT machines did. Helical CT (also called spiral CT) has several advantages over older CT techniques: it is faster and produces better quality 3-D pictures of areas inside the body, which may improve detection of small abnormalities.\n",
      "CT has many uses in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of cancer, including\n",
      "screening for cancer\n",
      "helping diagnose the presence of a tumor\n",
      "providing information about the stage of a cancer\n",
      "determining exactly where to perform (i.e., guide) a biopsy procedure\n",
      "guiding certain local treatments, such as cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and the implantation of radioactive seeds for brachytherapy\n",
      "helping plan external-beam radiation therapy or surgery\n",
      "determining whether a cancer is responding to treatment\n",
      "detecting recurrence of a tumor\n",
      "In addition, CT is widely used to help diagnose circulatory (blood) system diseases and conditions, such as coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis), blood vessel aneurysms, and blood clots; spinal conditions; kidney and bladder stones; abscesses; inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and sinusitis; and injuries to the head, skeletal system, and internal organs. CT imaging is also used to detect trauma, brain bleeds, and abnormal brain function or deposits in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease and other causes of cognitive decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What can a person expect during a CT procedure?\n",
      "\n",
      "During a CT procedure, the person lies very still on a table, and the table passes slowly through the center of a large donut-shaped x-ray machine. The person might hear whirring sounds during the procedure. At times during a CT procedure, the person may be asked to hold their breath to prevent blurring of the images.\n",
      "Sometimes, people having CT are given a contrast (imaging) agent, or dye, before the procedure. The contrast dye highlights specific areas inside the body, resulting in clearer pictures. The dye may be given by mouth, injected into a vein, or given by enema. Iodine and barium are two dyes commonly used in CT.\n",
      "In very rare cases, the contrast agents used in CT can cause allergic reactions. Some people experience mild itching or hives (small bumps on the skin). Symptoms of a more serious allergic reaction include shortness of breath and swelling of the throat or other parts of the body. People should tell the technologist immediately if they experience any of these symptoms so they can be treated promptly. Very rarely, the contrast agents used in CT can cause kidney problems for certain patients, such as those with impaired kidney function. Kidney function can be checked with a simple blood test before the contrast agent is injected.\n",
      "CT is a noninvasive procedure and does not cause any pain. However, lying in one position during the procedure may be slightly uncomfortable. The length of a CT procedure depends on the size of the area being scanned, but it usually lasts only a few minutes to half an hour. For most people, CT is performed on an outpatient basis at a hospital or a radiology center, without an overnight hospital stay.\n",
      "Some people are concerned about experiencing claustrophobia during a CT procedure. However, most CT scanners surround only portions of the body, not the whole body. Therefore, people are not enclosed in a machine and are unlikely to feel claustrophobic.\n",
      "People should let their health care provider and the technologist know if there is any possibility that they are pregnant. Depending on the part of the body to be scanned, the provider may reduce the radiation dose or use an alternative imaging method. However, the level of radiation exposure in a CT scan is believed to be too low to harm a growing fetus.\n",

      "How is CT used in cancer screening?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CT is used in both colorectal cancer screening (including screening for large polyps) and lung cancer screening.\n",
      "Colorectal cancer \n",
      "A procedure called CT colonography (also known as virtual colonoscopy) can be used to screen for both large colorectal polyps and colorectal tumors. Virtual colonoscopy is the use of CT to produce a series of pictures of the colon and the rectum from outside the body instead of using a colonoscope to view the inside of the colon and rectum. The effective dose to the patient from a CT colonography procedure is similar to that of a standard CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which is about 6 millisieverts (mSv) (1). (By comparison, the estimated average annual dose received from natural sources of radiation is about 3 mSv.) \n",
      "Although CT colonography is effective for visualizing tumors and adenomas, it has potential downsides. One is that if polyps or other abnormal growths are found during a virtual colonoscopy, a standard colonoscopy is needed to remove them. Also, CT colonography can lead to the unintentional discovery of medical findings in areas outside the colon and rectum that require additional follow-up procedures to rule out the unlikely possibility that these findings indicate real problems.  \n",
      "Lung cancer\n",
      "Low-dose CT of the lungs is used to screen for lung cancer in adults who are increased risk because of their smoking history. The risk of lung cancer in those who have never smoked tobacco products is generally so low that they would be unlikely to benefit from lung cancer screening.\n",
      "The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for people ages 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year or more smoking history (which they could have if, for example, they smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years or two packs of cigarettes per day for 10 years) and either currently smoke or quit smoking within the last 15 years (2). The estimated effective dose of radiation in a low-dose lung CT scan is 1.5 mSv (1). \n",
      "The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that three annual low-dose CT screens for lung cancer reduced lung-cancer mortality by 20% (3). However, there are potential harms as well as benefits. For example, people screened with low-dose lung CT can have false-positive results (that is, findings that appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present), which need monitoring and may necessitate invasive procedures to rule out cancer. Overdiagnosis—finding and treating a cancer that would not have caused problems during someone’s lifetime—is also a possibility, although there is little, if any, evidence of overdiagnosis after extended follow-up of the NLST (4). Also, because low-dose lung CT can produce images of organs and tissues outside the lung, it is possible that abnormalities outside of the lungs, such as renal or thyroid masses, may be found. As with extracolonic findings from CT colonography, some such findings will be serious, but many will not. NCI’s Patient and Physician Guide: National Lung Screening Trial provides more information on the benefits and harms of CT screening for lung cancer.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "What is total-body, or whole-body, CT?\n",
      "\n",
      "Total-body, or whole-body, CT creates pictures of nearly every area of the body—from the chin to below the hips. This procedure, which is used routinely in patients who already have cancer, can also be used in people who do not have any symptoms of disease. \n",
      "However, whole-body CT has not been shown to be an effective screening method for healthy people. Most abnormal findings from this procedure do not indicate a serious health problem, but the tests that must be done to follow up and rule out a problem can be expensive, inconvenient, and uncomfortable. Also, they may expose the patient to extra risks, such as from an invasive procedure like a biopsy that may be needed to evaluate the findings. \n",
      "In addition, whole-body CT can expose people to relatively large amounts of ionizing radiation—an effective dose of about 10 to 20 mSv, or more than three times the estimated average annual dose received from natural sources of radiation. \n",
      "Most doctors recommend against whole-body CT for people without any signs or symptoms of disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is combined PET/CT?\n",
      "\n",
      "Combined PET/CT uses two imaging methods, CT and positron emission tomography (PET), in one procedure. CT is done first to create anatomic pictures of the organs and structures in the body, and then PET is done to create pictures that provide functional data about the metabolic pathways (chemical reactions that take place in a cell to create and use energy) that are active in tissues or cells. Cancer cells often use different metabolic pathways than normal cells.\n",
      "Patients undergoing a PET/CT procedure are administered a positron-emitting (radioactive) substance, or radiopharmaceutical, that is designed to target cancer cells specifically. Numerous radiopharmaceuticals have been developed. However, the most common PET procedure uses an imaging agent called FDG (a radioactive form of the sugar glucose). Because cancerous tumors usually metabolize glucose more rapidly than normal tissues, they take up more FDG and appear different from other tissues on a PET scan. \n",
      "Other PET imaging agents can provide information about the level of oxygen in a particular tissue, the formation of new blood vessels, the presence of bone growth, whether tumor cells are actively dividing and growing, and whether cancer may have spread. For example, two prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)–targeted imaging drugs with attached radioactive tracers—piflufolastat F-18 (Pylarify) and Ga-68 gozetotide (Locametz)—are used for PET/CT imaging of PSMA-positive lesions in men with suspected prostate cancer metastases. The estimated effective dose from a PSMA PET procedure is 3 mSv (5). \n",
      "Combining CT and PET may provide a more complete picture of a tumor’s location and growth or spread than either test alone. The combined procedure may improve the ability to diagnose cancer, to determine how far a tumor has spread, to plan treatment, and to monitor response to treatment. Combined PET/CT may also reduce the number of additional imaging tests and other procedures a patient may need. The effective dose from a whole-body combined PSMA PET/CT procedure can range from 4 to 23 mSv depending on the specifics of the imaging protocol (1, 6).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the radiation from CT harmful?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people may be concerned about the amount of radiation they receive during CT. CT imaging involves the use of x-rays, which are a form of ionizing radiation. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to increase the risk of cancer. Standard x-ray procedures, such as routine chest x-rays and mammography, use relatively low levels of ionizing radiation. The radiation exposure from CT is higher than that from standard x-ray procedures, but the increase in cancer risk from one CT scan is still small. The benefits of a CT scan, especially if it is being used to diagnose cancer or another serious condition in someone who has signs or symptoms of disease, greatly outweigh any potential health risks.\n",
      "It is also important to note that everyone is exposed to some background level of naturally occurring ionizing radiation every day. The average person in the United States receives an estimated effective dose of about 3 millisieverts (mSv) per year from naturally occurring radioactive materials, such as radon and radiation from outer space (1). By comparison, the radiation exposure from one low-dose CT scan of the chest (1.5 mSv) is comparable to 6 months of natural background radiation, and a typical CT scan of the chest (6.1 mSv) is comparable to 2 years of natural background radiation (1).\n",
      "The widespread use of CT and other procedures that use ionizing radiation to create images of the body has raised concerns that even small increases in cancer risk could lead to large numbers of future cancers (7, 8). Women are at a somewhat higher risk than men of developing cancer after receiving the same radiation exposures at the same ages (9).\n",
      "People considering CT should talk with their doctors about whether the procedure is necessary for them and about its risks and benefits. Some organizations recommend that people keep a record of the imaging examinations they have received in case their doctors don’t have access to all of their health records. A sample form, called My Medical Imaging History, was developed by the Radiological Society of North America, the American College of Radiology, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It includes questions to ask the doctor before undergoing any x-ray exam or treatment procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the risks of CT scans for children? \n",
      "\n",
      "Radiation exposure from CT scans affects adults and children differently. Children are more sensitive to radiation than adults because of their growing bodies and the rapid pace at which the cells in their bodies divide. In addition, because children have potentially many more years of life ahead of them than adults, there is a greater opportunity for them to develop radiation-related cancers (10).\n",
      "In a large multinational study, individuals who had at least one CT scan before the age of 22 were found to have an increased risk of developing hematological cancers, particularly lymphoid and myeloid cancers and acute leukemia (11). In the 12 years after a single CT scan, the risk of cancer was about 1–2 cases for every 10,000 scans performed on children and young people.\n",
      "In talking with health care providers, three key questions that parents can ask are: \n",
      "Why is the test needed? \n",
      "Will the results change the treatment decisions? \n",
      "Is there an alternative test that doesn’t involve radiation? \n",
      "If the test is clinically justified, then the parents can be reassured that the benefits will outweigh the small long-term risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is being done to reduce the level of radiation exposure from CT?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to concerns about the increased risk of cancer associated with CT and other imaging procedures that use ionizing radiation, several organizations and government agencies have developed guidelines and recommendations regarding the appropriate use of these procedures.\n",
      "The Image Gently campaign seeks to raise awareness about methods to reduce radiation doses during pediatric medical imaging examinations.\n",
      "The Image Wisely campaign aims to lower the amount of radiation used in medically necessary imaging studies and eliminating unnecessary procedures.\n",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging focuses on the safe use of medical imaging devices, informed decision-making about when to use specific imaging procedures, and increasing patients’ awareness of their radiation exposure.\n",
      "The NIH Clinical Center requires that radiation dose exposures from CT and other imaging procedures be included in the electronic medical records of patients treated at the center (12). In addition, all imaging equipment purchased by NIH must provide data on exposure in a form that can be tracked and reported electronically. This patient protection policy is being adopted by other hospitals and imaging facilities.\n",
      "NCI’s guide for health care providers, Radiation Risks and Pediatric Computed Tomography (CT): A Guide for Health Care Providers, addresses the value of CT as a diagnostic tool in children, unique considerations for radiation exposure in children, risks to children from radiation exposure, and measures to minimize exposure.\n",
      "The American College of Radiology (ACR) has developed the ACR Appropriateness Criteria®, evidence-based guidelines to help providers make appropriate imaging and treatment decisions for a number of clinical conditions.\n",
      "ACR has also established the Dose Index Registry, which collects anonymized information related to dose indices for all CT exams at participating facilities.\n",
      "CT scanner manufacturers are developing newer detector systems and image reconstruction algorithms that can provide higher quality images at much lower radiation doses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is NCI doing to improve CT imaging?\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers funded by NCI are studying ways to improve the use of CT in cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. NCI also conducts and sponsors clinical trials that are testing ways to improve CT or new uses of CT imaging technology. Some of these clinical trials are run by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, one of the groups in NCI’s National Clinical Trials Network. \n",
      "NCI’s Cancer Imaging Program (CIP), part of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), funds cancer-related basic, translational, and clinical research in imaging sciences and technology. CIP supports the development of novel imaging agents for CT and other types of imaging procedures to help doctors better locate cancer cells in the body. In addition, CIP maintains the Cancer Imaging Archive, which is a library of medical images of cancer, including low-dose CT images, that are accessible for public download. This library has been used extensively by outside researchers in developing computer-aided diagnosis to help radiologists interpret CT images, for example, in lung cancer screening. \n",

      " Extragonadal germ cell tumors are a type of cancer that originates outside of the gonads (testes or ovaries). These tumors can occur in various sites such as the mediastinum, pineal region, and sacrococcygeal region. The treatment for extragonadal germ cell tumors depends on the specific location and stage of the tumor.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the primary treatments for extragonadal germ cell tumors include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In some cases, a combination of these modalities may be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "For localized tumors, surgery is often the primary treatment. The goal of surgery is to completely remove the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. For tumors that cannot be removed surgically or have spread beyond the local area, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chemotherapy is a systemic treatment that uses drugs to destroy cancer cells throughout the body. It is often used for advanced-stage extragonadal germ cell tumors or when surgery is not an option. Commonly used chemotherapeutic agents include cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiation therapy is a localized treatment that uses high-energy radiation to destroy cancer cells in a specific area of the body. It is often used for tumors in sensitive areas such as the brain or spinal cord. Radiation therapy may also be used after surgery to help prevent recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the best treatment for extragonadal germ cell tumors depends on the location and stage of the tumor. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are the primary treatments used, either alone or in combination. The specific treatment plan is determined by a team of healthcare professionals, including oncologists, radiologists, and surgeons.\n",

Careful initial diagnostic evaluation to define the location and to determine the extent of primary and metastatic tumor involvement is critical for the appropriate care of patients. In general, symptoms, physical signs, laboratory findings, and perceived risk of distant metastasis lead to an evaluation for distant metastatic disease. Additional tests such as bone scans and computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may be performed if initial assessments suggest metastases or if patients with stage III disease are being evaluated for aggressive local and combined modality treatments.Stage has a critical role in the selection of therapy. The stage of disease is based on a combination of clinical factors and pathological factors.[1] The distinction\n",

      "and/or immunotherapy or targeted therapy). Radiation therapy can be used for palliation.Evaluation of mediastinal lymph node metastasisSurgical evaluationSurgical staging of the mediastinum is considered standard if accurate evaluation of the nodal status is needed to determine therapy. Accurate staging of the mediastinal lymph nodes provides important prognostic information. Evidence (nodal status):The association between survival and the number of examined lymph nodes during surgery for patients with stage I NSCLC treated with definitive surgical resection was assessed from the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results  (SEER) Program database for the period from 1990 to 2000.[2] A total of 16,800 patients were included in the study.The overall survival  analysis for patients without radiation therapy was done by comparing the reference group (one to four lymph nodes) with the following groups:Patients with five to eight lymph nodes examined during surgery had a modest but statistically significant increase in survival, with a proportionate hazard ratio (HR) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84–0.97). For patients with 9 to 12 examined lymph nodes, the HR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79–0.95). For patients with 13 to 16 examined lymph nodes, the HR was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.68–0.90). There appeared to be no incremental improvement after evaluating more than 16 lymph nodes.  The corresponding results for lung cancer–specific mortality and for patients who received radiation therapy were not substantially different.These results indicate that patient survival following resection for NSCLC is associated with the number of lymph nodes evaluated during surgery. Because this is most likely the result of a reduction-of-staging error, namely, a decreased likelihood of missing positive lymph nodes with an increasing number of lymph nodes sampled, it suggests that an evaluation of nodal status should include  11 to 16 lymph nodes.CT imagingCT scanning is primarily used for determining the size of the tumor.   The CT scan should extend inferiorly to include the liver and adrenal glands. MRI scans of the thorax and upper abdomen do not appear to yield advantages over CT scans.[3]Evidence (CT scan):A systematic review of the medical literature relating to the accuracy of CT scanning for noninvasive staging of the mediastinum in patients with lung cancer was conducted.   In the 35 studies published  between 1991  and June 2006,   5,111 evaluable patients were identified. Almost all studies specified that CT scanning was performed following the administration of intravenous contrast material and that a positive test result was defined as the presence of one or more lymph nodes that measured larger than 1 cm on the short-axis diameter.[4] The median prevalence of mediastinal metastasis was 28% (range, 18%–56%).The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning for identifying mediastinal lymph node metastasis were 51% (95% CI, 47%–54%) for sensitivity and 86% (95% CI, 84%–88%) for specificity. Corresponding positive (3.4%) and negative (0.6%) likelihood ratios were provided.The results from the systematic review are similar to those of a large meta-analysis that reported the median sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning for identifying malignant mediastinal nodes as 61% for sensitivity and 79% for specificity.[5]An earlier meta-analysis reported an average sensitivity rate of 64% and specificity rate of 74%.[6]18F-FDG PET scanningThe wider availability and use of 18F-FDG PET scanning for staging has modified the approach to staging mediastinal lymph nodes and distant metastases. Randomized trials evaluating the utility of 18F-FDG PET scanning in potentially resectable NSCLC patients reported conflicting results in terms of the relative reduction in the number of noncurative thoracotomies.Although the current evidence is conflicting, 18F-FDG PET scanning may improve results of early-stage lung cancer by identifying patients who have evidence of metastatic disease that is beyond the scope of surgical resection and that is not evident by standard preoperative staging procedures.Evidence (18F-FDG PET scan):A systematic review, an expansion of a health technology assessment conducted in 2001 by the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences, evaluated the accuracy and utility of 18F-FDG PET scanning in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer.[7]  Through a systematic search of the literature, 12 evidence summary reports and 15 prospective studies of the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET scanning were identified.  18F-FDG PET scanning appears to be superior to CT imaging for mediastinal staging in NSCLC. 18F-FDG PET scanning also appears to have high sensitivity and reasonable specificity for differentiating benign from malignant lesions as small as 1 cm.A systematic review of the medical literature relating to the accuracy of 18F-FDG PET scanning for noninvasive staging of the mediastinum in patients with lung cancer identified 44 studies published between 1994 and 2006 with 2,865 evaluable patients.[4]   The median prevalence of mediastinal metastases was 29% (range, 5%–64%). Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for identifying mediastinal metastasis were 74% (95% CI, 69%–79%) for sensitivity and 85% (95% CI, 82%–88%) for specificity.Corresponding positive (4.9%) and negative (0.3%) likelihood ratios were provided for mediastinal staging with 18F-FDG PET scanning. These findings demonstrated that 18F-FDG PET scanning is more accurate than CT scanning for staging of the mediastinum in patients with lung cancer.Decision analyses demonstrate that 18F-FDG PET scanning may reduce the overall costs of medical care by identifying patients with falsely negative CT scans in the mediastinum or otherwise undetected sites of metastases.[8-10] Studies concluded that the money saved by forgoing mediastinoscopy in 18F-FDG PET-positive mediastinal lesions was not justified because of the unacceptably high number of false-positive results.[8-10]  A randomized study found that the addition of 18F-FDG PET scanning to conventional staging was associated with significantly fewer thoracotomies.[11] A second randomized trial evaluating the impact of 18F-FDG PET scanning on clinical management found that 18F-FDG PET scanning provided additional information regarding appropriate stage but did not lead to significantly fewer thoracotomies.[12]Combination of CT imaging and 18F-FDG PET scanningThe combination of CT imaging and 18F-FDG PET scanning has greater sensitivity and specificity than  CT imaging alone.[13]Evidence (CT/18F-FDG PET scan):If there is no evidence of distant metastatic disease on CT scan, 18F-FDG PET scanning complements CT scan staging of the mediastinum. Numerous nonrandomized studies of 18F-FDG PET scanning have evaluated mediastinal lymph nodes using surgery (i.e., mediastinoscopy and/or thoracotomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection) as the gold standard of comparison. A meta-analysis evaluated the conditional test performance of 18F-FDG PET scanning and CT scanning. The median sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET scans were reported as 100% for sensitivity and 78% for specificity in patients with enlarged lymph nodes.[5] 18F-FDG PET scanning is considered very accurate in identifying malignant nodal involvement when lymph nodes are enlarged. However, 18F-FDG PET scanning will falsely identify a malignancy in approximately one-fourth of patients with lymph nodes that are enlarged for other reasons, usually as a result of inflammation or infection.[14,15] The median sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET scanning in patients with normal-sized mediastinal lymph nodes were 82% for sensitivity and 93% for specificity.[5] These data indicate that nearly 20% of patients with normal-sized lymph nodes but with malignant involvement had falsely negative 18F-FDG PET scan findings.For patients with clinically operable NSCLC, the evidence supports performing a biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes that are found  to be larger than 1 cm in shortest transverse axis on chest CT scan or are found to be positive on 18F-FDG PET scan. Negative 18F-FDG PET scanning does not preclude biopsy of radiographically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Mediastinoscopy is necessary for the detection of cancer in mediastinal lymph nodes when the results of the CT scan and 18F-FDG PET scan do not corroborate each other.Evaluation of brain metastasisPatients at risk of brain metastases may be staged with CT or MRI scans.  Evidence (staging with CT or MRI):One study randomly assigned 332 patients with potentially operable NSCLC  and no neurological symptoms to brain CT or MRI imaging to detect occult brain metastasis before lung surgery.[16]MRI showed a trend towards a higher preoperative detection rate than CT scan (P = .069), with an overall detection rate of approximately 7% from pretreatment to 12 months after surgery. Patients with stage I or stage II disease had a detection rate of 4% (i.e., 8 detections out of 200 patients); however, individuals with stage III disease had a detection rate of 11.4% (i.e., 15 detections out of 132 patients). The mean maximal diameter of the brain metastases was significantly smaller in the MRI group. Whether the improved detection rate of MRI translates into improved outcome remains unknown. Not all patients are able to tolerate MRI, and for these patients contrast-enhanced CT scan is a reasonable substitute.Evaluation of distant metastasis to sites other than the brainNumerous nonrandomized, prospective, and retrospective studies have demonstrated that 18F-FDG PET scanning offers diagnostic advantages over conventional imaging in staging distant metastatic disease; however, standard 18F-FDG PET scans have limitations. 18F-FDG PET scans may not extend below the pelvis and may not detect bone metastases in the long bones of the lower extremities. Because the metabolic tracer used in 18F-FDG PET scanning accumulates in the brain and urinary tract, 18F-FDG PET scanning is not reliable for detection of metastases in these sites.[16]The Revised International  System for Staging Lung CancerThe Revised International System for Staging Lung Cancer, based on information from a clinical database of more than 5,000 patients, was adopted in 2010 by\n",

AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM DefinitionsThe AJCC has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define NSCLC.[18]Table 1.

A superficial, spreading tumor of any size whose invasive component is limited to the bronchial wall and may extend proximal to the main bronchus also is classified as T1a, but these tumors are uncommon. T1bTumor >1 cm but ≤2 cm in greatest dimension. T1cTumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension.T2Tumor >3 cm but ≤5 cm or having any of the following features: involves the main bronchus regardless of distance to the carina, but without involvement of the carina; invades visceral pleura (PL1 or PL2); associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region, involving part or all of the lung. T2 tumors with these features are classified as T2a if ≤4 cm or if the size cannot be determined and T2b if >4 cm but ≤5 cm. T2aTumor >3 cm but ≤4  cm in greatest dimension. T2bTumor >4 cm but ≤5 cm in greatest dimension.T3Tumor >5 cm but ≤7 cm in greatest dimension or directly invading any of the following: parietal pleura (PL3), chest wall (including superior sulcus tumors), phrenic nerve, parietal pericardium; or separate tumor nodule(s) in the same lobe as the primary.T4Tumor >7 cm or tumor of any size invading one or more of the following: diaphragm, mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral body, or carina; separate tumor nodule(s) in an ipsilateral lobe different from that of the primary.Table 2.

      " Adverse Effects\n",
      "Serious adverse effects of acupuncture are rare.  Reported accidents and infections appear to be related to violations of sterile procedure, negligence of the practitioner, or both.[1,2] A systematic review of case reports on the safety of acupuncture, involving 98 papers published in the English language from 22 countries during the period from 1965 to 1999, found only 202 incidents. The number of incidents appeared to decline as training standards and licensure requirements were enhanced. Among the 118 (60%) reported incidents involving infection, 94 (80%) involved hepatitis, occurring mainly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Very few hepatitis or other infections associated with acupuncture have been reported since 1988, when widespread use of disposable needles was introduced and national certification requirements for clean-needle techniques were developed and enforced as an acupuncture licensure requirement.[3,4] Because cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy are immunocompromised,  precautions must be taken and strict clean-needle techniques must be applied when acupuncture treatment is given.[5] Minor adverse effects of acupuncture such as the following, have been reported:Pain at needling sites.Hematoma.Tiredness.Lightheadedness.Drowsiness.Localized skin irritation.These minor adverse effects can be minimized by appropriate patient management, including local pressing and massage at the needling site after treatment.[6,7] ReferencesLao L: Acupuncture techniques and devices.

      "possible.  To qualify for a level of evidence analysis, a study must:Be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.Report on a therapeutic outcome or outcomes, such as tumor response, improvement in survival, or measured improvement in quality of life.Describe clinical findings in sufficient detail that a meaningful evaluation can be made.Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., endpoints) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For an explanation of the scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis, see the Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.It is noteworthy that almost all reported clinical studies on the effects of acupuncture on cancer or cancer therapy–related symptoms focus on symptom management rather than the disease itself. Investigations into the effects of acupuncture on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, many of which were randomized and well-controlled, produced the most convincing findings.  A number of randomized controlled trials have reported on the effect of acupuncture in alleviating other cancer treatment-associated side effects, with many showing promising evidence supporting the use of acupuncture.  Additional phase III clinical trials are ongoing.  \n",

The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.Normally, the bone marrow  makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell.

A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell. In CML, too many blood stem cells become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes.   These granulocytes are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. They are also called leukemia cells. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.  When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.This summary is about chronic myelogenous leukemia. See the\n",

DNA is contained inside chromosomes.  In CML, part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome.  This change is called the “Philadelphia chromosome.”  It results in the bone marrow making a protein, called tyrosine kinase,  that causes too many stem cells to become white blood cells (granulocytes or blasts).The Philadelphia chromosome is not passed from parent to child. EnlargeThe Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is an abnormal chromosome that is made when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and trade places. The ABL gene from chromosome 9 joins to the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to form the BCR::ABL fusion gene. The changed chromosome 22 with the fusion gene on it is called the Ph chromosome. Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia.The following tests and procedures may be used:Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease such as an enlarged spleen.

      "Cytogenetic analysis:  A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes,  such as the Philadelphia chromosome, may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization): A laboratory test used to look at and count genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of DNA that contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction test (RT–PCR): A laboratory test in which the amount of a genetic substance called mRNA made by a specific gene is measured. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to convert a specific piece of RNA into a matching piece of DNA, which can be amplified (made in large numbers) by another enzyme called DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT-PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or chromosome, which may help diagnose cancer.Certain factors affect prognosis (chance\n",

      "\t\t  is important to know the phase in order to plan treatment. The information from tests and procedures done to diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia is also used to plan treatment.Chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases.As the amount of blast cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.  This may result in infections, anemia, and easy bleeding, as well as bone pain and pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side. The number of blast cells in the blood and bone marrow and the severity of signs or symptoms determine the phase of the disease.Chronic phaseIn chronic phase CML, fewer than 10% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells.Accelerated phaseIn accelerated phase CML, 10% to 19% of the cells in  the blood and bone marrow are blast cells.Blastic phaseIn blastic phase CML, 20% or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells.  When tiredness, fever, and an enlarged spleen occur during the blastic phase, it is called blast crisis.Chronic myelogenous leukemia can relapse (return) after it has been treated.In relapsed CML, the number of blast cells increases after a remission.\n",

      "\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n",
      "\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.Six types of standard treatment are used:Targeted therapyTargeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor  therapy: This treatment blocks the enzyme, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to develop into more white blood cells (blasts) than the body needs. Imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, nilotinib, ponatinib, bosutinib, and asciminib  are tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat CML. See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information.Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information.ImmunotherapyImmunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer.  Interferon: Interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information.High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cell transplant is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.See Drugs Approved for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia for more information.EnlargeDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is a cancer treatment that may be used after stem cell transplant.  Lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) from the stem cell transplant donor are removed from the donor’s blood and may be frozen for storage.  The donor’s lymphocytes are thawed if they were frozen and then given to the patient through one or more infusions.  The lymphocytes see the patient’s cancer cells as not belonging to the body and attack them.Surgery Splenectomy is surgery\n",

      "\t\t\t NCI website.Treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia may cause side effects.For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, visit our Side Effects page.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.Follow-up tests may be needed.As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some tests that were done to diagnose or stage the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). \n",

The summary states that hydrazine sulfate has been studied as an anticancer treatment for over 30 years, both alone and in combination with established treatments. However, it has not shown any anticancer activity in randomized clinical trials, and data concerning its effectiveness in treating cancer-related cachexia are inconclusive. The use of hydrazine sulfate as an anticancer treatment outside of clinical trials has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, there is no evidence that hydrazine sulfate can cure cancer based on the information provided in the context.\n",

      "changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About NeuroblastomaRevised text to state that the incidence is 8.3 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years. Also added text to state that the overall incidence of neuroblastoma cases in the United States has remained stable (cited Campbell et al. as reference 9).Added text about the epidemiological trends in incidence and outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma between 2003 and 2019 based on the United States Cancer Statistics database and the National Program of Cancer Registries survival database.Added text to state that with increased availability of sequencing techniques, the spectrum of germline alterations seen in patients with neuroblastoma is expanding. For example, one study identified a series of 11 patients with germline pathogenic variants in SMARCA4 (cited Witkowski et al. as reference 29). Also added text to state that BARD1, ERCC2, CHEK2, and MSH3 were the genes in which variants were most commonly observed. Variants in BARD1, EZH2, ALK, PTCH1, and MSH3 were specifically enriched in patients with neuroblastoma, compared with controls.Genomic and Biological Features of NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that next-generation sequencing or  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to identify TERT alterations. One study identified TERT rearrangements by FISH in 6% of all patients with neuroblastic tumors regardless of risk group and in 12.4% of patients with high-risk neuroblastic tumors (cited Yu et al. as reference 42).Stage Information for NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that one study of 50 children with neuroblastoma evaluated the role of gadolinium contrast as part of magnetic resonance imaging scans. Assessment of tumor size and image-defined risk factors appeared similar regardless of whether gadolinium was used (cited Morin et al. as reference 13).Treatment of High-Risk NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that these more favorable outcomes for patients with stage 4N disease were confirmed in a single-institution study of 51 patients (cited Kushner et al. as reference 5).Added text to state that an updated report describes the results of a propensity matching analysis that compared patients who were treated with eflornithine with patients in  the ANBL0032 trial who were not treated with eflornithine (cited Oesterheld et al. as reference 57). Propensity matching generally balanced differences in available patient characteristics. In the matched analysis, patients in the eflornithine cohort had statistically significantly higher event-free survival and overall survival, compared with patients in the non-eflornithine cohort. The authors note that uncontrolled confounders may exist in this nonrandomized comparison. Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of eflornithine as continuation therapy in December 2023.This summary is written and maintained by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is\n",

It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.Reviewers and UpdatesThis summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:be discussed at a meeting,be cited with text, orreplace or update an existing article that is already cited.Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.The lead reviewers for Neuroblastoma Treatment are:Steven DuBois, MD, MS (Dana Farber Cancer Institute)Andrea A. Hayes-Dixon, MD, FACS, FAAP (Howard University)Karen J. Marcus, MD, FACR (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Hospital)Nita Louise Seibel, MD (National Cancer Institute)Stephen J. Shochat, MD (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital)Malcolm A. Smith, MD, PhD (National Cancer Institute)Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's Email Us. Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.Levels of EvidenceSome of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board uses a formal evidence ranking system in developing its level-of-evidence designations.Permission to Use This SummaryPDQ is a registered trademark.

The multidisciplinary team at this CCBIR Center is also integrating computational and experimental approaches to understand the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant sites. \n",
      "Dr. Vadim Backman, Dr. Daniela Matei, and Dr. Hao Zhang, are principal investigators of the  Northwestern University Center for Chromatin NanoImaging in Cancer. This CCBIR Center is developing, testing, and deploying new nanoimaging technologies (that could be used in combination with molecular and computational methods) to address research questions related to the origin of cancer stem cells and their ability to adapt to chemotherapies. \n",
      "The Center for Multiparametric Imaging of Tumor Immune Microenvironments at the University of Minnesota, led by Dr. Paolo Provenzano and Dr. Kevin Eliceiri, is advancing and developing live cell and tissue imaging platforms and quantitative analyses. Additionally, they are using these novel technologies to characterize physical barriers that limit anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy.\n",

      " According to the context provided, there is no definitive treatment for advanced-stage ovarian low malignant potential tumors as the value of complete staging has not been demonstrated in these cases. However, it is recommended that the opposite ovary be carefully evaluated for evidence of bilateral disease. In some studies, up to 18% of patients with presumed localized tumors were upstaged following complete surgical staging. When a patient wishes to retain childbearing potential, a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is adequate therapy. In the presence of bilateral ovarian cystic neoplasms or a single ovary, a partial oophorectomy can be employed when fertility is desired by the patient. Some physicians stress the importance of limiting ovarian cystectomy to stage IA patients in whom the margins of the cystectomy specimens are free of tumor. When childbearing is not a consideration, a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is appropriate therapy. Once a woman has completed her family, most physicians favor removal of remaining ovarian tissue as it is at risk of recurrence of a borderline tumor or even rarely, a carcinoma.\n",

      "The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as\n",
      "new information becomes available.  This section describes the latest\n",
      "changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About NeuroblastomaRevised text to state that the incidence is 8.3 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years. Also added text to state that the overall incidence of neuroblastoma cases in the United States has remained stable (cited Campbell et al. as reference 9).Added text about the epidemiological trends in incidence and outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma between 2003 and 2019 based on the United States Cancer Statistics database and the National Program of Cancer Registries survival database.Added text to state that with increased availability of sequencing techniques, the spectrum of germline alterations seen in patients with neuroblastoma is expanding. For example, one study identified a series of 11 patients with germline pathogenic variants in SMARCA4 (cited Witkowski et al. as reference 29). Also added text to state that BARD1, ERCC2, CHEK2, and MSH3 were the genes in which variants were most commonly observed. Variants in BARD1, EZH2, ALK, PTCH1, and MSH3 were specifically enriched in patients with neuroblastoma, compared with controls.Genomic and Biological Features of NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that next-generation sequencing or  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to identify TERT alterations. One study identified TERT rearrangements by FISH in 6% of all patients with neuroblastic tumors regardless of risk group and in 12.4% of patients with high-risk neuroblastic tumors (cited Yu et al. as reference 42).Stage Information for NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that one study of 50 children with neuroblastoma evaluated the role of gadolinium contrast as part of magnetic resonance imaging scans. Assessment of tumor size and image-defined risk factors appeared similar regardless of whether gadolinium was used (cited Morin et al. as reference 13).Treatment of High-Risk NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that these more favorable outcomes for patients with stage 4N disease were confirmed in a single-institution study of 51 patients (cited Kushner et al. as reference 5).Added text to state that an updated report describes the results of a propensity matching analysis that compared patients who were treated with eflornithine with patients in  the ANBL0032 trial who were not treated with eflornithine (cited Oesterheld et al. as reference 57). Propensity matching generally balanced differences in available patient characteristics. In the matched analysis, patients in the eflornithine cohort had statistically significantly higher event-free survival and overall survival, compared with patients in the non-eflornithine cohort. The authors note that uncontrolled confounders may exist in this nonrandomized comparison. Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of eflornithine as continuation therapy in December 2023.This summary is written and maintained by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is\n",

      "Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of neuroblastoma. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.Reviewers and UpdatesThis summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:be discussed at a meeting,be cited with text, orreplace or update an existing article that is already cited.Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.The lead reviewers for Neuroblastoma Treatment are:Steven DuBois, MD, MS (Dana Farber Cancer Institute)Andrea A. Hayes-Dixon, MD, FACS, FAAP (Howard University)Karen J. Marcus, MD, FACR (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Hospital)Nita Louise Seibel, MD (National Cancer Institute)Stephen J. Shochat, MD (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital)Malcolm A. Smith, MD, PhD (National Cancer Institute)Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's Email Us. Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.Levels of EvidenceSome of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board uses a formal evidence ranking system in developing its level-of-evidence designations.Permission to Use This SummaryPDQ is a registered trademark.

      "\t\t  in the pelvis, one on each\n",
      "\t\t  side of the uterus (the hollow,\n",

      "\t\t  grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries\n",
      "\t\t  make eggs and female hormones. EnlargeAnatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium. Signs and symptoms of ovarian low malignant potential tumor include pain or swelling in the abdomen.Ovarian low malignant potential tumor may not cause early signs or symptoms. If you do have signs or symptoms, they may include the following:Pain or swelling in the abdomen.Pain in the pelvis.Gastrointestinal problems, such as gas, bloating, or constipation.These signs and symptoms may be caused by other conditions. If they get worse or do not go away on their own, check with your doctor.Tests that examine the ovaries are used to diagnose and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor.The following tests and procedures may be used:Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum.    A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A Pap test of the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.EnlargePelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.EnlargeAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is passed over the surface of the abdomen. The ultrasound transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).Other patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound. \n",

      "EnlargeTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\n",

This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About Renal Cell CancerUpdated statistics with estimated new cases and deaths for 2024 (cited American Cancer Society as reference 1).Treatment of Stage I Renal Cell CancerRevised the list of treatment options for stage I renal cell cancer.Added text to state that, in appropriately selected patients, partial nephrectomy has oncologic outcomes that are comparable with radical nephrectomy. Partial nephrectomy also has the benefits of preserving greater renal function and, according to some studies, reduced mortality (cited Kim et al., Larcher et al., Wang et al., and Patel et al. as references 4–7, respectively). Also added text to state that radical nephrectomy is preferred if the tumor extends into the inferior vena cava.Added text to state that, for patients who are not candidates for resection, there are several curative alternatives, including cryoablation, thermal ablation and stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy (cited EI Dib et al., Gkentzis et al., Zargar et al., Salagierski et al., and Siva et al. as references 9–13, respectively).Treatment of Stage II Renal Cell CancerAdded text to state that, in appropriately selected patients, partial nephrectomy has oncologic outcomes that are comparable with radical nephrectomy. Partial nephrectomy also has the benefits of preserving greater renal function and, according to some studies, reduced mortality (cited Kim et al., Larcher et al., Wang et al., and Patel et al. as references 3–6, respectively). Also added text to state that radical nephrectomy is preferred if the tumor extends into the inferior vena cava.Revised text about the results of the KEYNOTE-564 trial to state that a subsequent report with a median follow-up of 30 months showed a 75.2% disease-free survival (DFS) rate for patients who received pembrolizumab, compared with 65.5% for patients who received placebo (cited Powles et al. as reference 7).

      "A measure of the number of neutrophils in the blood. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell. They help the body fight infection. An absolute neutrophil count may be used to check for infection, inflammation, leukemia, and other conditions. The lower a person's absolute neutrophil count is, the higher the risk is of getting an infection.   Having an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500 means there is a high risk of getting an infection.  Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, may reduce the absolute neutrophil count.

      "Go to Patient VersionThis cancer information summary provides an overview of the use of Cannabis and its components as a treatment for people with cancer-related symptoms caused by the disease itself or  its treatment.This summary contains the following key information:Cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years.By federal law, the possession of Cannabis is illegal in the United States, except within approved research settings; however, a growing number of states, territories, and the District of Columbia have enacted laws to legalize its medical and/or recreational use.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved Cannabis as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition.Chemical components of Cannabis, called cannabinoids, activate specific receptors throughout the body to produce pharmacological effects, particularly in the central nervous system  and the immune system.Commercially available cannabinoids, such as dronabinol and nabilone,  are approved drugs for the treatment of cancer-related side effects.Cannabinoids may have benefits in the treatment of cancer-related side effects.Many of the medical and scientific terms used in this summary are hypertext linked (at first use in each section) to the NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms, which is oriented toward nonexperts. When a linked term is clicked, a definition will appear in a separate window. Reference citations in some PDQ cancer information summaries may include links to external websites that are operated by individuals or organizations for the purpose of marketing or advocating the use of specific treatments or products.

      "General Information\n",
      "Cannabis, also known as marijuana, originated in Central Asia but is grown worldwide today.  In the United States, it is a controlled substance and is classified as a Schedule I agent (a drug with a high potential for abuse, and no currently accepted medical use).    The Cannabis plant produces a resin containing 21-carbon terpenophenolic compounds called cannabinoids, in addition to other compounds found in plants, such as terpenes and flavonoids.  The highest concentration of cannabinoids is found in the female flowers of the plant.[1] Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid, but over 100 other cannabinoids have been reported to be present in the plant. Cannabidiol (CBD) does not produce the characteristic altered consciousness associated with Cannabis. It is felt to have potential therapeutic effectiveness and has recently been approved in the form of the pharmaceutical Epidiolex for the treatment of refractory seizure disorders in children. Other cannabinoids that are being investigated for potential medical benefits include cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV).  Clinical trials conducted on medicinal Cannabis are limited. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) has not approved the use of Cannabis as a treatment for any medical condition, although both isolated THC and CBD pharmaceuticals are licensed and approved. To conduct clinical drug research with botanical Cannabis in the United States, researchers must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA, obtain a Schedule I license from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and obtain approval from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.In the 2018 United States Farm Bill, the term hemp is used to describe cultivars of the Cannabis species that contain less than 0.3% THC.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Hemp oil or CBD oil are products manufactured from extracts of industrial hemp (i.e., low-THC cannabis cultivars), whereas hemp seed oil is an edible fatty oil that is essentially cannabinoid-free (see Table 1). Some products contain  other botanical extracts and/or over-the-counter analgesics. These products are readily available  as oral and topical tinctures or other formulations often advertised for pain management and other purposes. Hemp  products containing less than 0.3% of delta-9-THC are not scheduled drugs and could be considered as Farm Bill compliant. Hemp is not a controlled  substance; however, CBD  is a controlled substance.Table 1.

Although few relevant surveys of practice patterns exist, it appears that physicians caring for patients with cancer in the United States who recommend medicinal Cannabis do so predominantly for symptom management.[3] A growing number of pediatric patients are seeking symptom relief with Cannabis or cannabinoid treatment, although studies are limited.[4] The American Academy of Pediatrics has not endorsed Cannabis and cannabinoid use because of concerns about brain development.This summary will review the role of Cannabis and the cannabinoids in the treatment of people with cancer and  disease-related or treatment-related side effects. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) hosted a virtual meeting, the NCI Cannabis, Cannabinoids, and Cancer Research Symposium,  on December 15–18, 2020. The seven sessions are summarized in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs and contain basic science and clinical information as well as a summary of the barriers to conducting Cannabis research.[5-11]ReferencesAdams IB, Martin BR: Cannabis: pharmacology and toxicology in animals and humans.

One study of radiation for lung and head and neck cancers, with or without chemotherapy, noted significant diarrhea despite no direct radiation to the large or small intestine.  Higher rates were noted for chemoradiation (42%) than for radiation alone (29%).  Additionally, this radiation-induced diarrhea  was associated with worse health outcomes and increased resource utilization.  Individuals with moderate or severe diarrhea were more likely to have a gastrostomy tube placement, weight loss, unplanned office visits, more inpatient days, and longer radiation breaks.  This early report requires additional validation studies to fully evaluate the prevalence and impact of this phenomenon.[4]Acute enteritis occurs during or within 3 months after irradiation, with the greatest prevalence during the fourth and fifth weeks. Acute enteritis symptoms usually resolve 2 to 3 weeks after the completion of treatment, and the mucosa may appear nearly normal.[1]Management of acute radiation enteritisMedical management includes treating diarrhea, dehydration, malabsorption, and\n",

      "Questions and Answers About Black Cohosh\n",
      "What is black cohosh?\n",
      "Black cohosh is a plant in the buttercup family that grows in eastern and midwestern North America. Its scientific name is Actaea racemosa (also called Cimicifuga racemosa). Black cohosh is also called black snakeroot, bugbane, rattleroot, squawroot, and macrotrys or macrotys. The underground stems and roots of the black cohosh plant are used in herbal supplements.Black cohosh was first used by American Indian or Alaska Native people. Extracts from black cohosh have been used as medicine to treat menopausal symptoms in Europe for over 50 years. In Germany, black cohosh has been approved to treat menstrual period pain, menopausal symptoms, fast heartbeat, nervousness, irritability, sleep problems, noise or ringing in the ears, dizziness, sweating, and depression.How is black cohosh taken or given?Black cohosh is taken or given by mouth as a dietary supplement. It is sold as a powdered herb, whole herb, liquid, or dried extract in pill form.\n",
      "What laboratory or animal studies have been done using black cohosh?In laboratory studies, tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies, tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people.Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of black cohosh. For information on laboratory and animal studies done using black cohosh, see the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version of Black Cohosh.\n",
      "Have any studies of black cohosh been done in people?\n",
      "Observational studies of postmenopausal women without a history of breast cancer have not shown a link between black cohosh and breast cancer prevention. However, one case-control trial found that postmenopausal women who took black cohosh had a 53% decrease in risk of breast cancer compared to postmenopausal women who did not take black cohosh. A retrospective cohort study of patients with breast cancer and survivors of breast cancer who took black cohosh extract also showed lower risk of recurrence.Observational and open-label studies have shown some benefits of black cohosh on menopausal symptoms in cancer and noncancer populations. However, clinical trials have not confirmed these effects.A review of observational studies of patients with breast cancer and survivors of breast cancer looked at the effects of taking an herbal supplement with black cohosh extract with or without hormone therapy on menopausal symptoms. Patients who took black cohosh reported fewer and less severe hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. An open label study in Germany showed similar results in breast cancer survivors who took black cohosh and a hormone therapy.Have any side effects or risks been reported from black cohosh?Few side effects have been reported from the use of black cohosh. The most common side effects were nausea, joint pain, and rashes. Side effects are likely related to problems with product quality rather than black cohosh itself.A few studies have reported that the risk of interactions between black cohosh and other medicines is small. One study found that black cohosh may lower the effect of medicines that reduce cholesterol levels, such as statins.\n",
      "Is black cohosh approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n",
      "         for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?\n",
      "FDA has not approved the use of black cohosh as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition.Black cohosh  is available in the United States as a dietary supplement. The FDA does not approve dietary supplements as safe or effective. The company that makes the dietary supplements is responsible for making sure that they are safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. The way that supplements are made is not regulated by the FDA, so all batches and brands of black cohosh supplements may not be the same.\n"

Deficiency in AAT can lead to emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as the lack or abnormal form of AAT allows these enzymes to break down the elastic tissue in the lungs, leading to their destruction and impaired lung function. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. There are three types of AAT deficiency: M, S, and Z. The most common form is the M variant, which accounts for about 95% of all cases. In contrast, the S and Z variants are much less common and result in more severe forms of the disease.\n",

      "In This SectionCannabis and Cannabinoids Interactions With Conventional Cancer TherapiesCannabis and Cannabinoids Because cannabinoid receptors, unlike opioid receptors, are not located in the brainstem areas controlling respiration, lethal overdoses from Cannabis and cannabinoids do not occur.[1-4] However, cannabinoid receptors are present in other tissues throughout the body, not just in the central nervous system,  and adverse effects include the following: Tachycardia.Hypotension.Conjunctival injection.Bronchodilation.Muscle relaxation.Decreased gastrointestinal motility.Although cannabinoids are considered by some to be addictive drugs, their addictive potential is considerably lower than that of other prescribed agents or substances of abuse.[2,4]  The brain develops a tolerance to cannabinoids.Withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, insomnia with sleep electroencephalogram disturbance, restlessness, hot flashes, and, rarely, nausea and cramping have been observed. However, these symptoms appear to be mild compared with  withdrawal symptoms associated with opiates or benzodiazepines, and the symptoms usually dissipate after a few days.Unlike other commonly used drugs, cannabinoids are stored in adipose tissue and excreted at a low rate (half-life 1–3 days), so even abrupt cessation of cannabinoid intake is not associated with rapid declines in plasma concentrations that would precipitate  severe or abrupt withdrawal symptoms or drug cravings.Cannabidiol  (CBD) is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms in vitro. Because many anticancer therapies are metabolized by these enzymes, highly concentrated CBD oils used concurrently could potentially increase the toxicity or decrease the effectiveness of these therapies.[5-7]Since Cannabis smoke contains many of the same components as tobacco smoke, there are valid concerns about the adverse pulmonary effects of inhaled Cannabis. A longitudinal study in a noncancer population evaluated repeated measurements of pulmonary function over  20 years in 5,115 men and women whose smoking histories were known.[8] \n",
      "\n",
      "While tobacco exposure was associated with decreased pulmonary function, the investigators concluded that occasional and low-cumulative Cannabis use was not associated with adverse effects on pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]).Interactions With Conventional Cancer TherapiesThe potential for cytochrome P450 interactions with highly concentrated oil preparations of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and/or cannabidiol is a concern.[9] Few pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted with Cannabis or cannabinoids and conventional cancer therapies. A small study investigated the effect of Cannabis tea in 24 patients who received irinotecan or docetaxel.[10] Administration of the Cannabis tea did not significantly influence exposure to and clearance of either intravenous agent. An Israeli retrospective observational study assessed the impact of Cannabis use during nivolumab immunotherapy.[11] One hundred forty patients with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma received the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (89 patients received nivolumab alone and  51 patients received nivolumab plus Cannabis). In a multivariate model, Cannabis was the only significant factor that reduced the response rate to  immunotherapy (37.5% in patients who received nivolumab alone compared with 15.9% in patients who received  nivolumab plus Cannabis [odds ratio, 3.13;  95% confidence interval, 1.24–8.1; P = .016]). There was no difference in progression-free survival or overall survival. A subsequent prospective observational study from the same investigators followed 102 patients with metastatic cancers initiating immunotherapy.[12][Level of evidence: 2Dii] Sixty-eight patients received immunotherapy alone while 34 patients used Cannabis during immunotherapy. Over half of the patients in each group had stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Cannabis users were less likely to receive immunotherapy as a first-line intervention (24%) compared with  nonusers (46%) (P = .03). Cannabis users showed a significantly lower percentage of clinical benefit (39% of Cannabis users with complete or partial responses or stable disease compared with 59% of nonusers [P = .035]). In this analysis, the median time to tumor progression was 3.4 months in Cannabis users compared with 13.1 months in nonusers and the overall survival was 6.4 months in Cannabis users compared with 28.5 months in nonusers. The investigators also noted that Cannabis users reported a lower rate of overall treatment-related adverse experiences compared with nonusers, with fewer immune-related adverse events (P = .057). The investigators postulated that this finding may be related to the  possible immunosuppressive effects of Cannabis and concluded that Cannabis consumption should be carefully considered in patients with advanced malignancies who are treated with immunotherapy. Limitations noted by the authors that may be confounders in this analysis include the observational nature of the study, the relatively small sample size, and the high heterogeneity of the participants.ReferencesAdams IB, Martin BR: Cannabis: pharmacology and toxicology in animals and humans.

      "Summary of the Evidence for Cannabis and Cannabinoids\n",
      "To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for people with cancer, the strength of the evidence (i.e., the levels of evidence) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever possible. To qualify for a level of evidence analysis, a study must:Be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.Report on therapeutic outcome or outcomes, such as tumor response, improvement in survival, or measured improvement in quality of life.Describe clinical findings in sufficient detail for a meaningful evaluation to be made.Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., endpoints) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For an explanation of possible scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) treatments for people with cancer, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.CannabinoidsSeveral controlled clinical trials have been performed, and meta-analyses of these support a beneficial effect of cannabinoids (dronabinol and nabilone) on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (N/V) compared with placebo.    Both dronabinol and nabilone are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the prevention or treatment of chemotherapy-induced N/V in cancer patients but not for other symptom management.CannabisThere have been ten clinical trials on the use of inhaled Cannabis in cancer patients that can be divided into two groups.  In one group, four small studies assessed antiemetic activity, but each explored a different patient population and chemotherapy regimen.  One study demonstrated no effect, the second study showed a positive effect versus placebo, and the report of the third study did not provide enough information to characterize the overall outcome as positive or neutral.  Consequently, there are insufficient data to provide an overall level of evidence assessment for the use of Cannabis for chemotherapy-induced N/V. Apparently, there are no published controlled clinical trials on  the use of inhaled Cannabis for other cancer-related or cancer treatment–related symptoms.An increasing number of trials are evaluating the oromucosal administration of Cannabis plant extract with fixed concentrations of cannabinoid components, with national drug regulatory agencies in Canada and in some European countries that issue approval for cancer pain.At present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend  inhaling  Cannabis as a treatment for cancer-related symptoms or cancer treatment–related symptoms or cancer treatment-related side effects; however, additional research is needed.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Several different kinds of tumors can grow in bones: primary bone tumors, which form from bone tissue and can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (not cancerous), and metastatic tumors (tumors that develop from cancer cells that formed elsewhere in the body and then spread to the bone). Malignant primary bone tumors (primary bone cancers) are less common than benign primary bone tumors. Both types of primary bone tumors may grow and compress healthy bone tissue, but benign tumors usually do not spread or destroy bone tissue and are rarely a threat to life.\n",
      "Primary bone cancers are included in the broader category of cancers called sarcomas. (Soft-tissue sarcomas—sarcomas that begin in muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, or other supporting tissue of the body, including synovial sarcoma—are not addressed in this fact sheet.)\n",
      "Primary bone cancer is rare. It accounts for much less than 1% of all new cancers diagnosed. In 2018, an estimated 3,450 new cases of primary bone cancer will be diagnosed in the United States (1).\n",
      "Cancer that metastasizes (spreads) to the bones from other parts of the body is called metastatic (or secondary) bone cancer and is referred to by the organ or tissue in which it began—for example, as breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone. In adults, cancerous tumors that have metastasized to the bone are much more common than primary bone cancer. For example, at the end of 2008, an estimated 280,000 adults ages 18–64 years in the United States were living with metastatic cancer in bones (2).\n",
      "Although most types of cancer can spread to the bone, bone metastasis is particularly likely with certain cancers, including breast and prostate cancers. Metastatic tumors in the bone can cause fractures, pain, and abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood, a condition called hypercalcemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the different types of primary bone cancer?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of primary bone cancer are defined by which cells in the bone give rise to them.\n",
      "Osteosarcoma\n",
      "Osteosarcoma arises from bone-forming cells called osteoblasts in osteoid tissue (immature bone tissue). This tumor typically occurs in the arm near the shoulder and in the leg near the knee in children, adolescents, and young adults (3) but can occur in any bone, especially in older adults. It often grows quickly and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lungs. Risk of osteosarcoma is highest among children and adolescents ages 10 and 19. Males are more likely than females to develop osteosarcoma. Among children, osteosarcoma is more common in blacks and other racial/ethnic groups than in whites, but among adults it is more common in whites than in other racial/ethnic groups. People who have Paget disease (a benign bone condition characterized by abnormal development of new bone cells) or a history of radiation to their bones also have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma.\n",
      "Chondrosarcoma\n",
      "Chondrosarcoma begins in cartilaginous tissue. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that covers the ends of bones and lines the joints. Chondrosarcoma most often forms in the pelvis, upper leg, and shoulder and usually grows slowly, although sometimes it can grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. Chondrosarcoma occurs mainly in older adults (over age 40). The risk increases with advancing age. A rare type of chondrosarcoma called extraskeletal chondrosarcoma does not form in bone cartilage. Instead, it forms in the soft tissues of the upper part of the arms and legs.\n",
      "Ewing sarcoma\n",
      "Ewing sarcoma usually arises in bone but may also rarely arise in soft tissue (muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, or other supporting tissue). Ewing sarcomas typically form in the pelvis, legs, or ribs, but can form in any bone (3). This tumor often grows quickly and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lungs. The risk of Ewing sarcoma is highest in children and adolescents younger than 19 years of age. Boys are more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma than girls. Ewing sarcoma is much more common in whites than in blacks or Asians.\n",
      "Chordoma \n",
      "Chordoma is a very rare tumor that forms in bones of the spine. These tumors usually occur in older adults and typically form at the base of the spine (sacrum) and at the base of the skull. About twice as many men as women are diagnosed with chordoma. When they do occur in younger people and children, they are usually found at the base of the skull and in the cervical spine (neck).\n",
      "Several types of benign bone tumors can, in rare cases, become malignant and spread to other parts of the body (4). These include giant cell tumor of bone (also called osteoclastoma) and osteoblastoma. Giant cell tumor of bone mostly occurs at the ends of the long bones of the arms and legs, often close to the knee joint (5). These tumors, which typically occur in young and middle-aged adults, can be locally aggressive, causing destruction of bone. In rare cases they can spread (metastasize), often to the lungs. Osteoblastoma replaces normal hard bone tissue with a weaker form called osteoid. This tumor occurs mainly in the spine (6). It is slow-growing and occurs in young and middle-aged adults. Rare cases of this tumor becoming malignant have been reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the possible causes of bone cancer?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although primary bone cancer does not have a clearly defined cause, researchers have identified several factors that increase the likelihood of developing these tumors.\n",
      "Previous cancer treatment with radiation, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. Osteosarcoma occurs more frequently in people who have had high-dose external radiation therapy (particularly at the location in the body where the radiation was given) or treatment with certain anticancer drugs, particularly alkylating agents; those treated during childhood are at particular risk. In addition, osteosarcoma develops in a small percentage (approximately 5%) of children undergoing myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n",
      "Certain inherited conditions. A small number of bone cancers are due to hereditary conditions (3). For example, children who have had hereditary retinoblastoma (an uncommon cancer of the eye) are at a higher risk of developing osteosarcoma, particularly if they are treated with radiation. Members of families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome are at increased risk of osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma as well as other types of cancer. Additionally, people who have hereditary defects of bones have an increased lifetime risk of developing chondrosarcoma. Childhood chordoma is linked to tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic disorder in which benign tumors form in the kidneys, brain, eyes, heart, lungs, and skin. Although Ewing sarcoma is not strongly associated with any heredity cancer syndromes or congenital childhood diseases (7, 8), accumulating evidence suggests a strong inherited genetic component to Ewing sarcoma risk (9).\n",
      "Certain benign bone conditions. People over age 40 who have Paget disease of bone (a benign condition characterized by abnormal development of new bone cells) are at increased risk of developing osteosarcoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of bone cancer?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer, but not all bone cancers cause pain. Persistent or unusual pain or swelling in or near a bone can be caused by cancer or by other conditions. Other symptoms of bone cancer include a lump (that may feel soft and warm) in the arms, legs, chest, or pelvis; unexplained fever; and a bone that breaks for no known reason. It is important to see a doctor to determine the cause of any bone symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is bone cancer diagnosed?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To help diagnose bone cancer, the doctor asks about the patient’s personal and family medical history. The doctor also performs a physical examination and may order laboratory and other diagnostic tests. These tests may include the following:\n",
      "X-rays, which can show the location, size, and shape of a bone tumor. If x-rays suggest that an abnormal area may be cancer, the doctor is likely to recommend special imaging tests. Even if x-rays suggest that an abnormal area is benign, the doctor may want to do further tests, especially if the patient is experiencing unusual or persistent pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tA bone scan, which is a test in which a small amount of radioactive material is injected into a blood vessel and travels through the bloodstream; it then collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.\n",
      "A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan, which is a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles, that are created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine.\n",
      "A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure, which uses a powerful magnet linked to a computer to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body without using x-rays.\n",
      "A positron emission tomography (PET) scan, in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is used. Because cancer cells often use more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer cells in the body.\n",
      "An angiogram, which is an x-ray of blood vessels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biopsy (removal of a tissue sample from the bone tumor) to determine whether cancer is present. The surgeon may perform a needle biopsy, an excisional biopsy, or an incisional biopsy. During a needle biopsy, the surgeon makes a small hole in the bone and removes a sample of tissue from the tumor with a needle-like instrument. For excisional biopsy, the surgeon removes an entire lump or suspicious area for diagnosis. In an incisional biopsy, the surgeon cuts into the tumor and removes a sample of tissue. Biopsies are best done by an orthopedic oncologist (a doctor experienced in the treatment of bone cancer) because the placement of the biopsy incision can influence subsequent surgical options. A pathologist (a doctor who identifies disease by studying cells and tissues under a microscope) examines the tissue to determine whether it is cancerous.\n",
      "Blood tests to determine the levels of two enzymes called alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Large amounts of these enzymes may be present in the blood of people with osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma. High blood levels of alkaline phosphatase occur when the cells that form bone tissue are very active—when children are growing, when a broken bone is mending, or when a disease or tumor causes production of abnormal bone tissue. Because high levels of alkaline phosphatase are normal in growing children and adolescents, this test is not a reliable indicator of bone cancer.\n",

      " Cancer risk can be measured through various methods and assessed using different tools and models. Here are some common ways to measure cancer risk:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Population-level risk: This refers to the overall risk of developing a specific type of cancer within a given population based on demographic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. For instance, population studies can identify trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates across different age groups, genders, ethnicities, or geographical locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Individual risk assessment: This involves evaluating an individual's personal risk factors for developing cancer based on their medical history, lifestyle choices, family history, and genetic predisposition. Tools like the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool can help estimate a woman's risk of developing breast cancer based on factors such as age, race, family history, and reproductive history.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Screening tests: Regular screening tests, such as mammograms for breast cancer or colonoscopies for colorectal cancer, can help identify early signs of cancer in individuals who may be at higher risk due to their age, family history, or other factors. The results of these tests can provide valuable information about an individual's current cancer risk and the need for further evaluation or preventive measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Genetic testing: For certain types of cancer, such as those associated with inherited genetic mutations (e.g., breast cancer and ovarian cancer), genetic testing can help identify individuals who are at increased risk due to their family history or specific genetic markers. This information can guide preventive measures, such as more frequent screening or prophylactic surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Biomarker analysis: Researchers are continually studying various biomarkers (proteins, genes, or other molecules) that may be associated with an increased risk of developing specific types of cancer. For example, the presence of certain biomarkers in the blood or tissue samples can help identify individuals who are at higher risk for developing certain cancers and guide preventive measures or early intervention strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Simulation modeling: Researchers use simulation models to study the impact of various factors on population-level cancer risk, such as prevention strategies, screening programs, and treatment interventions. These models help researchers understand the potential benefits and limitations of different approaches for reducing cancer incidence and mortality.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Surveillance systems: National and international cancer surveillance systems collect data on cancer incidence, mortality, and trends to monitor the overall burden of cancer and identify areas where prevention efforts could be improved. These systems also help researchers evaluate the effectiveness of cancer control programs and inform policy decisions related to cancer prevention and treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Clinical trials: Ongoing clinical trials investigate new approaches for measuring and reducing cancer risk, such as novel screening technologies, targeted interventions based on genetic or biomarker data, and lifestyle modifications to reduce cancer risk. These studies contribute valuable knowledge about the underlying causes of cancer and potential strategies for prevention and early detection.\n",

Noncancerous conditions can sometimes cause an increase in the level of a tumor marker. In addition, not everyone with a particular type of cancer will have a higher level of a tumor marker associated with that cancer. Therefore, measurements of tumor markers are usually combined with the results of other tests, such as biopsies or imaging, to diagnose cancer. \n",

Biomarkers are generally measured in samples of tumor tissue. However, tumors can shed cells or bits of biological material into blood, and these can be measured by tests called liquid biopsies. \n",
      "How well the treatment is working. Periodic (or “serial”) measurements of a marker made while someone is undergoing treatment can indicate whether the tumor is responding to treatment.\n",

      "A number of tumor marker tests are currently being used for a wide range of cancer types. See the list of tumor marker tests in common use for more information.\n",
      "Many tumor marker tests are carried out by commercial and academic laboratories. Sometimes cancer centers use a tumor marker test developed within a single clinical laboratory (also known as a lab-developed test or LDT) to meet a specific medical need. All tumor markers, including those tested by LDTs, are tested in laboratories that meet standards set by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can tumor markers be used to detect cancer in people who don't have symptoms?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because tumors produce markers that can be measured in blood and other body fluids, researchers have hoped that they might also be useful in screening people for cancer—that is, detecting cancer at an early stage before it causes symptoms.\n",
      "However, studies to see whether circulating tumor markers can be used to screen for cancer have generally found that these markers do not work well for screening. They often don’t identify everyone with the disease (they are not sensitive enough). Or they may indicate the possible presence of cancer in people who don’t actually have cancer (they are not specific enough).\n",
      "Researchers are now testing whether multi-cancer detection tests (MCDs), which analyze multiple biomarkers in the blood of people without symptoms, can identify early cancers.\n",
      "Most MCDs examine DNA that tumor cells release into blood. They may also analyze other biological molecules in blood, such as proteins. Tests that look at tumor markers in blood and other body fluids are sometimes called liquid biopsy tests.\n",
      "Although many MCD tests are in development and several are already being marketed, much remains to be learned about how best to use these tests and their harms and benefits. A critical question is whether treating the cancers identified by MCD tests would reduce deaths from these cancers. NCI will be launching a clinical trial to better understand the implications of using MCD tests to screen for cancer.\n",

      "What research is under way to develop additional tumor markers?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "NCI’s Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), a collaborative consortium of academic and private-sector investigators, has focused on the systematic discovery, development, and validation of biomarkers and imaging methods to detect early-stage cancers and to assess risk for developing cancer. One goal of EDRN is to develop biomarkers that can distinguish aggressive early-stage cancers from slow-growing cancers that would never cause symptoms to reduce overtreatment. \n",
      "Cancer researchers are turning to proteomics (the study of protein structure, function, and patterns of expression) and proteogenomics (the integration of proteomics with genomics and gene expression analysis, or transcriptomics) with the hope of developing novel biomarkers that can be used to identify cancer in its early stages, to predict the effectiveness of treatment, and to predict the chance of cancer recurrence.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly being investigated, including by EDRN, as tools to analyze and interpret patterns in genomic and proteomic markers that help predict cancer risk and diagnose specific cancer types.\n",
      "NCI’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) is using a proteogenomic approach for tumor marker discovery for a growing number of cancers, including colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancers. By systematically identifying proteins (and associated biological processes) that originate from alterations in cancer genomes, CPTAC researchers have discovered new tumor subtypes, tumor microenvironment variations, and new potential proteins for targeted drug therapy. Recent innovations have suggested that these analyses could be done on a microscale using very small amounts of tumor tissue obtain from a biopsy.\n",
      "The NCI Cancer MoonshotSM Biobank is working with patient participants at community hospitals around the country to encourage them to donate tissue and blood samples over the course of their cancer treatment. The samples are sent to researchers who use them to better understand cancer and potentially identify tumor markers.  \n",
      "More information on NCI’s role in supporting research on novel tools and methods for diagnosing cancer is available on the Cancer Diagnosis Research page.\n",

      "What are aristolochic acids?\n",
      "Aristolochic acids are a group of acids found naturally in many types of plants known as Aristolochia (birthworts or pipevines) and some types of plants known as Asarum (wild ginger), which grow worldwide.\n",
      "How are aristolochic acids used?\n",
      "Plants containing aristolochic acids are used in some herbal products intended to treat a variety of symptoms and diseases, such as arthritis, gout, and inflammation. These products have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are often marketed as dietary supplements or “traditional medicines.” \n",
      "How are people exposed to aristolochic acids?\n",
      "Exposure may occur through intentionally or unknowingly eating or drinking herbal or food products that contain aristolochic acids. \n",
      "Which cancers are associated with exposure to aristolochic acids?\n",
      "Cancers of the upper urinary tract (renal pelvis and ureter) and bladder have been reported among individuals who had kidney damage caused by the consumption of herbal products containing aristolochic acids.\n",
      "How can exposures be reduced?\n",
      "To reduce your risk, do not use herbal products that contain aristolochic acids. The FDA provides a list of some products containing aristolochic acids.\n",

Additionally, caregivers of advanced cancer patients may experience psychological burden and psychiatric morbidity (Shin et al., 2018; Rumpold et al., 2016).

      "This plan will inform activities for the Center for Global Health for 2021–2025. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Center for Global Health (CGH) was established to incorporate cancer control into global health programs, foster research within NCI and across the world, and develop partnerships with the global cancer research and control community. Much has been accomplished since 2011, and CGH remains committed to global impact, equity, and collaboration in its second decade. \n",
      "The 2021–2025 CGH Strategic Plan has updated goals and specific strategies, with a focus on supporting low- and middle-income countries.  \n",
      "Goals \n",
      "Research: support innovative, impactful research that (a) addresses key scientific issues in global cancer control and (b) leverages unique or unusual scientific opportunities afforded by collaboration with global partners \n",
      "Research Training: support cancer research training that enables equitable, impactful global scientific collaboration \n",
      "Dissemination: promote the integration of current scientific knowledge into global cancer control policies and practice \n",
      "Partnership: represent NCI and promote its engagement with key partners in global cancer research and control \n",
      "Strategic Priorities \n",
      "CGH will work towards these goals by identifying key scientific gaps in global cancer control, which will inform new extramural funding initiatives with other NCI extramural divisions and across the National Institutes of Health (NIH). CGH will also increase the number of low- and middle-income country collaborators through these new extramural funding initiatives by developing new funding opportunity announcements with foreign components and administering the grants. By supporting investigators who seek to expand international collaborations, CGH will promote equity in global cancer control research. Through CGH-supported partnerships, as well as non-NIH funding partnerships coordinated by CGH, investigators from low- and middle-income countries can increase their scientific research capacity and rigor in line with their country or organization’s needs. \n",
      "How CGH Measures Progress \n",
      "Throughout strategic plan implementation, CGH will solicit advice from internal and external advisory boards and continuously monitor progress toward goals. CGH will undergo an external evaluation in 2025 to inform an updated strategic plan for 2026–2030. \n",
      "For more information on how progress is measured across CGH programs, see the Evaluation Framework.\n",

      "This plan will inform activities for the Center for Global Health for 2021–2025. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Center for Global Health (CGH) was established to incorporate cancer control into global health programs, foster research within NCI and across the world, and develop partnerships with the global cancer research and control community. Much has been accomplished since 2011, and CGH remains committed to global impact, equity, and collaboration in its second decade. \n",
      "The 2021–2025 CGH Strategic Plan has updated goals and specific strategies, with a focus on supporting low- and middle-income countries.  \n",
      "Goals \n",
      "Research: support innovative, impactful research that (a) addresses key scientific issues in global cancer control and (b) leverages unique or unusual scientific opportunities afforded by collaboration with global partners \n",
      "Research Training: support cancer research training that enables equitable, impactful global scientific collaboration \n",
      "Dissemination: promote the integration of current scientific knowledge into global cancer control policies and practice \n",
      "Partnership: represent NCI and promote its engagement with key partners in global cancer research and control \n",
      "Strategic Priorities \n",
      "CGH will work towards these goals by identifying key scientific gaps in global cancer control, which will inform new extramural funding initiatives with other NCI extramural divisions and across the National Institutes of Health (NIH). CGH will also increase the number of low- and middle-income country collaborators through these new extramural funding initiatives by developing new funding opportunity announcements with foreign components and administering the grants. By supporting investigators who seek to expand international collaborations, CGH will promote equity in global cancer control research. Through CGH-supported partnerships, as well as non-NIH funding partnerships coordinated by CGH, investigators from low- and middle-income countries can increase their scientific research capacity and rigor in line with their country or organization’s needs. \n",
      "How CGH Measures Progress \n",
      "Throughout strategic plan implementation, CGH will solicit advice from internal and external advisory boards and continuously monitor progress toward goals. CGH will undergo an external evaluation in 2025 to inform an updated strategic plan for 2026–2030. \n",
      "For more information on how progress is measured across CGH programs, see the Evaluation Framework.\n",

      "Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of childhood and adult Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.Reviewers and UpdatesThis summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:be discussed at a meeting,be cited with text, orreplace or update an existing article that is already cited.Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.The lead reviewers for Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Treatment are:Louis S. Constine, MD (James P. Wilmot Cancer Center at University of Rochester Medical Center)Thomas G. Gross, MD, PhD (National Cancer Institute)Michael Jeng, MD (Stanford Medicine Children's Health)Kenneth L. McClain, MD, PhD (Texas Children's Cancer Center and Hematology Service at Texas Children's Hospital)Carlos Rodriguez-Galindo, MD (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital)Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's Email Us. Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.Levels of EvidenceSome of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board uses a formal evidence ranking system in developing its level-of-evidence designations.Permission to Use This SummaryPDQ is a registered trademark. Although the content of PDQ documents can be used freely as text, it cannot be identified as an NCI PDQ cancer information summary unless it is presented in its entirety and is regularly updated. However, an author would be permitted to write a sentence such as “NCI’s PDQ cancer information summary about breast cancer prevention states the risks succinctly: [include excerpt from the summary].”The preferred citation for this PDQ summary is:PDQ® Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board.

      "Go to Health Professional VersionKey PointsEsthesioneuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the upper nasal cavity and base of the skull.Signs and symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma include nosebleeds and the loss of sense of smell.Tests that examine the nasal cavity are used to help diagnose esthesioneuroblastoma.Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).Esthesioneuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the upper nasal cavity and base of the skull.Esthesioneuroblastoma begins in the olfactory nerve endings in the upper part of the nasal cavity. The olfactory nerves (sense of smell) pass through the many tiny holes in the bone at the base of the brain to the olfactory bulb. Esthesioneuroblastoma is also called olfactory neuroblastoma.EnlargeEsthesioneuroblastomas form in the olfactory nerve endings in the upper part of the nasal cavity. The olfactory nerves (sense of smell) pass through the many tiny holes in the bone at the base of the brain to the olfactory bulb. Esthesioneuroblastomas may spread from the nasal cavity to the nasal sinuses or to nearby tissue. They may also spread to the brain or to other parts of the body (not shown).Esthesioneuroblastoma affects adults and children. Even though it is very rare, esthesioneuroblastoma is the most common cancer of the nasal cavity in children and teens. This summary is about the treatment of children and teens with esthesioneuroblastoma.Signs and symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma include nosebleeds and the loss of sense of smell.These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by esthesioneuroblastoma or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:A mass in the nose.Trouble breathing through the nose.Change in or loss of the sense of smell.Nosebleeds.Headache.Bulging of the eye.Trouble seeing.Eye pain.Tests that examine the nasal cavity are used to help diagnose esthesioneuroblastoma.In addition to asking about your child's personal and family health history and doing a physical exam, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures.Nasal endoscopy: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. A flexible or rigid endoscope is inserted through the nose. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope by a pathologist for signs of disease.MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the head and neck. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the head and neck or lymph nodes, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.EnlargeComputed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following tests may be done on the sample of cells or tissues that were removed:Immunohistochemistry: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer. Genetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells or tissue are analyzed to look for changes in genes or chromosomes. These changes may be a sign that a person has or is at risk of having a specific disease or condition.Electron microscopy: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).The prognosis depends on the following:Whether the cancer is in the nose only or if it has spread to the nasal sinuses, lymph nodes, or to other parts of the body.Whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery.\n",

      "Stages of Esthesioneuroblastoma\n",
      "Key PointsAfter esthesioneuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. The following stages are used for esthesioneuroblastoma:Stage AStage BStage CStage DSometimes childhood esthesioneuroblastoma comes back after treatment.After esthesioneuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.The process used to find out if cancer has spread to tissues near the nasal cavity or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. The results of the tests used to diagnose cancer are often also used to stage the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. For more information on the tests used to diagnose esthesioneuroblastoma, see the General Information section.The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread:Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.PET-CT scan: Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy:  The removal of tissue or fluid from an enlarged lymph node, using a thin needle.  A pathologist views the tissue or fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\n",
      "Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.\n",
      "Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\n",
      "Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if esthesioneuroblastoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually esthesioneuroblastoma cells. The disease is metastatic esthesioneuroblastoma, not lung cancer.Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.The following stages are used for esthesioneuroblastoma:Stage AIn stage A, cancer is found in the nasal cavity only.Stage BIn stage B, cancer has spread from the nasal cavity to the nasal sinuses.Stage CIn stage C, cancer has spread through the nasal sinuses to nearby tissue.Stage DIn stage D, cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes in the neck, or to the brain, bone  marrow, or lung.Sometimes childhood esthesioneuroblastoma comes back after treatment.The cancer may recur (come back) in the original cancer site, central nervous system, or lymph nodes after it has been treated. \n",

      "Treatment Option Overview\n",
      "Key PointsThere are different types of treatment for children with esthesioneuroblastoma. Children with esthesioneuroblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.Three types of standard treatment are used:SurgeryRadiation therapyChemotherapyNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.Targeted therapyTreatment for childhood esthesioneuroblastoma may cause side effects.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for children with esthesioneuroblastoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.  A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.Children with esthesioneuroblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. This may include the following specialists and others:Pediatrician.Pediatric surgeon.Radiation oncologist.Pathologist.Pediatric nurse specialist.Social worker.Rehabilitation specialist.Psychologist.Child-life specialist.Three types of standard treatment are used:SurgerySurgery to remove the tumor is one of the main treatments used for esthesioneuroblastoma.After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.Radiation therapyRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.ChemotherapyChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.Targeted therapyTargeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood esthesioneuroblastoma that has recurred (come back).Treatment for childhood esthesioneuroblastoma may cause side effects.To learn more about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, visit Side Effects.Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:Physical problems.Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.Second cancers (new types of cancer) or other conditions.Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.  For more information, see Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer.Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.Follow-up tests may be needed. As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\n",

      "About PDQPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood esthesioneuroblastoma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.Reviewers and UpdatesEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\n",

      "Clinical Trial InformationA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n",

      "Three workshops have been sponsored by the NCI to assess the status of tissue-engineered systems in cancer and to identify gaps.   In April 2012, a Physical Sciences – Oncology Network (PS-ON) workshop was held to discuss areas where physical sciences principles from tissue engineering and developmental biology could open new avenues in cancer research. Participants highlighted the need for development of synthetic in vitro and ex vivo engineered systems to better probe key factors in tissues and their microenvironment important in cancer. The consensus of the participants was that these factors could be best studied in physiologically relevant and controlled tissue-engineered systems.  \n",
      "To further explore the status of tissue-engineered technologies in cancer, a second targeted PS-ON workshop on Biomimetic Tissue Engineered Systems for Advancing Cancer Research was held in February 2014. The workshop highlighted examples of how tissue-engineered technologies are currently being applied to cancer research to study angiogenesis, migration, and therapeutic resistance. Workshop participants identified areas for future focus based on existing research and gaps in cancer biology.  \n",
      "Finally, in April 2015, a joint workshop was held with the National Science Foundation on Additive Manufacturing for Tumor Engineering. The workshop highlighted several barriers to constructing tissue-engineered systems for cancer research, including the need for their robust pathophysiological characterization. Participants recommended the formation of multidisciplinary partnerships to construct and characterize tissue-engineered models of cancer. It was suggested that characterization of systems could include, but not be limited to, biological comparisons of in vivo and clinical datasets.\n",

      "Go to Patient VersionThis cancer information summary provides an overview of the use of acupuncture as a treatment for individuals with cancer or cancer-related disorders. The summary includes a brief history of acupuncture practice, a review of laboratory and animal studies, the results of clinical observations and trials, and possible side effects of acupuncture therapy. Information presented in some sections of the summary can also be found in tables located at the end of those sections.This summary contains the following key information:As part of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture has been practiced in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years.Acupuncture is defined as the application of stimulation such as needling, moxibustion, cupping, and acupressure on specific sites of the body known as acupuncture points.Acupuncture has been practiced in the United States for about 200 years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the acupuncture needle as a medical device in 1996.Acupuncture is used to treat a wide range of illnesses and ailments. Cancer patients use it for pain management, control of nausea and  vomiting (N/V),  fatigue, hot flashes, xerostomia, neuropathy, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance.Laboratory and animal studies exploring the mechanisms of acupuncture for cancer treatment have focused mainly on the role of acupuncture in the activation of neurohormonal pathways and immunomodulation. The aim of most acupuncture clinical observation and clinical trials in cancer patients has been to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on symptom management.The most convincing research data on the effects of acupuncture in cancer patients have emerged from studies of the management of chemotherapy-induced N/V.Many of the medical and scientific terms used in this summary are hypertext linked (at first use in each section) to the NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms, which is oriented toward nonexperts. When a linked term is clicked, a definition will appear in a separate window.Reference citations in some PDQ cancer information summaries may include links to external websites that are operated by individuals or organizations for the purpose of marketing or advocating the use of specific treatments or products. These reference citations are included for informational purposes only. Their inclusion should not be viewed as an endorsement of the content of the websites, or of any treatment or product, by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board or the National Cancer Institute.\n"

      "changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About NeuroblastomaRevised text to state that the incidence is 8.3 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years. Also added text to state that the overall incidence of neuroblastoma cases in the United States has remained stable (cited Campbell et al. as reference 9).Added text about the epidemiological trends in incidence and outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma between 2003 and 2019 based on the United States Cancer Statistics database and the National Program of Cancer Registries survival database.Added text to state that with increased availability of sequencing techniques, the spectrum of germline alterations seen in patients with neuroblastoma is expanding. For example, one study identified a series of 11 patients with germline pathogenic variants in SMARCA4 (cited Witkowski et al. as reference 29). Also added text to state that BARD1, ERCC2, CHEK2, and MSH3 were the genes in which variants were most commonly observed. Variants in BARD1, EZH2, ALK, PTCH1, and MSH3 were specifically enriched in patients with neuroblastoma, compared with controls.Genomic and Biological Features of NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that next-generation sequencing or  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to identify TERT alterations. One study identified TERT rearrangements by FISH in 6% of all patients with neuroblastic tumors regardless of risk group and in 12.4% of patients with high-risk neuroblastic tumors (cited Yu et al. as reference 42).Stage Information for NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that one study of 50 children with neuroblastoma evaluated the role of gadolinium contrast as part of magnetic resonance imaging scans. Assessment of tumor size and image-defined risk factors appeared similar regardless of whether gadolinium was used (cited Morin et al. as reference 13).Treatment of High-Risk NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that these more favorable outcomes for patients with stage 4N disease were confirmed in a single-institution study of 51 patients (cited Kushner et al. as reference 5).Added text to state that an updated report describes the results of a propensity matching analysis that compared patients who were treated with eflornithine with patients in  the ANBL0032 trial who were not treated with eflornithine (cited Oesterheld et al. as reference 57). Propensity matching generally balanced differences in available patient characteristics. In the matched analysis, patients in the eflornithine cohort had statistically significantly higher event-free survival and overall survival, compared with patients in the non-eflornithine cohort. The authors note that uncontrolled confounders may exist in this nonrandomized comparison. Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of eflornithine as continuation therapy in December 2023.This summary is written and maintained by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is\n",

      "Bladder cancer is caused by certain changes in how bladder cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. There are many risk factors for bladder cancer, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of DNA  damage in cells that may lead to bladder cancer. To learn more about how cancer develops, see What Is Cancer?A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for bladder cancer, like using tobacco, can be changed. Risk factors also include things people cannot change, like their age and family history. It’s important to learn about risk factors for bladder cancer because it can help you make choices that might lower your risk of getting it.\n",

      "Risk factors  for bladder cancer\n",
      "In the United States, bladder cancer occurs more often in men than in women, and more often in White individuals than in Black individuals. Bladder cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but the risk increases as a person gets older.Using tobacco, especially smoking cigarettes, is a major  risk factor for bladder cancer. Tobacco contains harmful chemicals called carcinogens. When you use tobacco, these chemicals get absorbed into the bloodstream, are filtered by the kidneys, and then collect in the urine. This exposes your bladder to high levels of these chemicals, which can damage  the DNA in the cells lining your bladder. Learn about different tools to help you quit smoking and how to use them.Other risk factors for bladder cancer includehaving a family history of bladder cancerhaving certain changes in the genes that are linked to bladder cancer, such as HRAS, RB1, PTEN/MMAC1, NAT2, and GSTM1being exposed to paints, dyes, metals, or petroleum products in the workplacepast treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis or with certain anticancer drugs, such as cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide taking the Chinese herb Aristolochia fangchi drinking water from a well that has high levels of arsenicdrinking water that has been treated with chlorinehaving a bladder infection caused by a parasite called Schistosoma haematobium, which is common in Africa and the Middle East but rare in the United Statesusing urinary catheters for a long timeHaving one or more of these risk factors does not necessarily mean you will get bladder cancer. Many people with risk factors never develop bladder cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Talk with your doctor if you think you might be at risk of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer screening  options may be available to you.\n",

      "What are antineoplastons?\n",
      "Antineoplastons are chemical compounds found in urine and blood.  They are made up of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) and peptides (compounds made  of two or more amino acids). When used in research, antineoplastons are made from chemicals in the laboratory.\n",
      "How are antineoplastons given?\n",
      "Antineoplastons are given by mouth or by injection (shot).\n",
      "Have any laboratory or animal studies  been done using antineoplastons?In laboratory studies, tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies, tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of antineoplastons in laboratory experiments. See the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the PDQ health professional summary on Antineoplastons for information on laboratory and animal studies done using antineoplastons.\n",
      "Have any  studies of antineoplastons been done in people?No phase III, randomized, controlled trials of antineoplastons as a treatment for cancer have been done. Phase I clinical trials, phase II clinical trials, and case reports have been reported.\n",
      " Cancer patients have been studied and treated with antineoplastons at the clinic where antineoplastons were first made. A few trials and case studies have been done outside of the clinic. Cancer types studied include breast,  bladder, cervical, prostate, liver, lung, brain, leukemia, and lymphoma. Some patients in the studies received standard  treatments and the antineoplastons. In those cases, it is not known if  responses and side effects were caused by antineoplaston therapy, the other treatments, or both.

      "About PDQPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of antineoplastons in the treatment of people with cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.Reviewers and UpdatesEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\n",

      "Clinical Trial InformationA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n",

      "General CAM Information\n",
      "Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation of CAM Therapies\n",
      "It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm.The NCI Best Case Series Program   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM\n",
      "When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: What side effects can be expected?What are the risks related to this therapy?What benefits can be expected from this therapy?Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?Will the therapy affect conventional treatment?Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?If so, who is the sponsor of the trial?Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?\n",

      " Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic drug that has been used to treat various types of cancers. In the context provided, it is mentioned that cisplatin has been reported to produce occasional responses in patients with metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. However, there is no mention of FDA approval specifically for this use of cisplatin in the given text. The text also mentions that some patients with distant metastases can be managed expectantly until they become symptomatic and that palliative chemotherapy, which may include cisplatin, can be considered for these patients. Other drugs used in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer are mentioned, including doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, dacarbazine, and 5-fluorouracil. The text also mentions ongoing clinical trials investigating new treatments for medullary thyroid cancer, including vandetanib, cabozantinib, and selpercatinib.\n",

      "Its central goal is to balance basic, pre-clinical, and translational research using an iterative team science structure that will enable hypothesis testing on the biological basis of resistance in clinically relevant model systems.\n",
      "ARTNet also aims to provide evidence along the shared tumor-tumor microenvironment (TME) continuum to inform new strategies that can be better translated into future clinical trials.\n",
      "Collectively, the network represents a range of treatment modalities (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, targeted agents, immunotherapies, combined modalities) and cancer types in pursuit of addressing compelling questions and significant barriers in acquired therapy resistance research.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lymph nodes are small round organs that are part of the body’s lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a part of the immune system. It consists of a network of vessels and organs that contains lymph, a clear fluid that carries infection-fighting white blood cells as well as fluid and waste products from the body’s cells and tissues. In a person with cancer, lymph can also carry cancer cells that have broken off from the main tumor.  \n",

Bottom inset shows a close-up of bone marrow.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lymph is filtered through lymph nodes, which are found widely throughout the body and are connected to one another by lymph vessels. Groups of lymph nodes are located in the neck, underarms, chest, abdomen, and groin. The lymph nodes contain white blood cells (B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes) and other types of immune system cells. Lymph nodes trap bacteria and viruses, as well as some damaged and abnormal cells, helping the immune system fight disease. \n",
      "Many types of cancer spread through the lymphatic system, and one of the earliest sites of spread for these cancers is nearby lymph nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a sentinel lymph node?\n",
      "\n",
      "A sentinel lymph node is defined as the first lymph node to which cancer cells are most likely to spread from a primary tumor. Sometimes, there can be more than one sentinel lymph node.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a sentinel lymph node biopsy?\n",
      "\n",
      "A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a procedure in which the sentinel lymph node is identified, removed, and examined to determine whether cancer cells are present. It is used in people who have already been diagnosed with cancer.\n",
      "A negative SLNB result suggests that cancer has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.\n",
      "A positive SLNB result indicates that cancer is present in the sentinel lymph node and that it may have spread to other nearby lymph nodes (called regional lymph nodes) and, possibly, other organs. This information can help a doctor determine the stage of the cancer (extent of the disease within the body) and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens during an SLNB?\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the sentinel lymph node (or nodes) must be located. To do so, a surgeon injects a radioactive substance, a blue dye, or both near the tumor. The surgeon then uses a device to detect lymph nodes that contain the radioactive substance or looks for lymph nodes that are stained with the blue dye. Once the sentinel lymph node is located, the surgeon makes a small incision in the overlying skin and removes the node.\n",
      "The sentinel node is then checked for the presence of cancer cells by a pathologist. If cancer is found, the surgeon may remove additional lymph nodes, either during the same biopsy procedure or during a follow-up surgical procedure. SLNB may be done on an outpatient basis or may require a short stay in the hospital.\n",
      "SLNB is usually done at the same time the primary tumor is removed. In some cases the procedure can also be done before or even after (depending on how much the lymphatic vessels have been disrupted) removal of the tumor. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the benefits of SLNB?\n",
      "\n",
      "SNLB helps doctors stage cancers and estimate the risk that tumor cells have developed the ability to spread to other parts of the body. If the sentinel node is negative for cancer, a patient may be able to avoid more extensive lymph node surgery, reducing the potential complications associated with having many lymph nodes removed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the possible harms of SLNB?\n",
      "\n",
      "All surgery to remove lymph nodes, including SLNB, can have harmful side effects, although removal of fewer lymph nodes is usually associated with fewer side effects, particularly serious ones such as lymphedema. The potential side effects include: \n",
      "Lymphedema, or tissue swelling. During lymph node surgery, lymph vessels leading to and from the sentinel node or group of nodes are cut. This disrupts the normal flow of lymph through the affected area, which may lead to an abnormal buildup of lymph fluid that can cause swelling. Lymphedema may cause pain or discomfort in the affected area, and the overlying skin may become thickened or hard. \n",
      "\tThe risk of lymphedema increases with the number of lymph nodes removed. There is less risk with the removal of only the sentinel lymph node. In the case of extensive lymph node removal in an armpit or groin, the swelling may affect an entire arm or leg. In addition, there is an increased risk of infection in the affected area or limb. Very rarely, chronic lymphedema due to extensive lymph node removal may cause a cancer of the lymphatic vessels called lymphangiosarcoma. \n",
      "Seroma, or a mass or lump caused by the buildup of lymph fluid at the site of the surgery\n",
      "Numbness, tingling, swelling, bruising, or pain at the site of the surgery, and an increased risk of infection\n",
      "Difficulty moving the affected body part\n",
      "Skin or allergic reactions to the blue dye used in SNLB\n",
      "A false-negative biopsy result—that is, cancer cells are not seen in the sentinel lymph node even though they have already spread to regional lymph nodes or other parts of the body. A false-negative biopsy result gives the patient and the doctor a false sense of security about the extent of cancer in the patient’s body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is SLNB used to help stage all types of cancer?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. SLNB is most commonly used to help stage breast cancer and melanoma. It is sometimes used to stage penile cancer (1) and endometrial cancer (2). However, it is being studied with other cancer types, including vulvar and cervical cancers (3), and colorectal, gastric, esophageal, head and neck, thyroid, and non-small cell lung cancers (4).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What has research shown about the use of SLNB in breast cancer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Breast cancer cells are most likely to spread first to lymph nodes located in the axilla, or armpit area, next to the affected breast. However, in breast cancers close to the center of the chest (near the breastbone), cancer cells may spread first to lymph nodes inside the chest (under the breastbone, called internal mammary nodes) before they can be detected in the axilla.\n",
      "The number of lymph nodes in the axilla varies from person to person; the usual range is between 20 and 40. Historically, all of these axillary lymph nodes were removed (in an operation called axillary lymph node dissection, or ALND) in women diagnosed with breast cancer. This was done for two reasons: to help stage the breast cancer and to help prevent a regional recurrence of the disease. (Regional recurrence of breast cancer occurs when breast cancer cells that have migrated to nearby lymph nodes give rise to a new tumor.) \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentinel lymph node biopsy of the breast. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor (first panel). The injected material is located visually and/or with a device that detects radioactivity (middle panel). The sentinel node(s) (the first lymph node(s) to take up the material) is (are) removed and checked for cancer cells (last panel).\n",
      "Credit: © Terese Winslow\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, because removing multiple lymph nodes at the same time increases the risk of harmful side effects, clinical trials were launched to investigate whether just the sentinel lymph nodes could be removed. Two NCI-sponsored randomized phase 3 clinical trials have shown that SLNB without ALND is sufficient for staging breast cancer and for preventing regional recurrence in women who have no clinical signs of axillary lymph node metastasis, such as a lump or swelling in the armpit that may cause discomfort, and who are treated with surgery, adjuvant systemic therapy, and radiation therapy.\n",
      "In one trial, involving 5,611 women, researchers randomly assigned participants to receive just SLNB, or SLNB plus ALND, after surgery (5). Those women in the two groups whose sentinel lymph node(s) were negative for cancer (a total of 3,989 women) were then followed for an average of 8 years. The researchers found no differences in overall survival or disease-free survival between the two groups of women. \n",
      "The other trial included 891 women with tumors up to 5 cm in the breast and one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive SLNB only or to receive ALND after SLNB (6). All of the women were treated with lumpectomy, and most also received adjuvant systemic therapy and external-beam radiation therapy to the affected breast. After extended follow-up, the two groups of women had similar 10-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and regional recurrence rates (7).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What has research shown about the use of SLNB in melanoma?\n",
      "Research indicates that patients with melanoma who have undergone SLNB and whose sentinel lymph node is found to be negative for cancer and who have no clinical signs that cancer has spread to other lymph nodes can be spared more extensive lymph node surgery at the time of primary tumor removal. A meta-analysis of 71 studies with data from 25,240 patients found that the risk of regional lymph node recurrence in patients with a negative SLNB was 5% or less (8).\n",

      "\n",
      "Findings from the Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II (MSLT-II) also confirmed the safety of SLNB in people with melanoma with positive sentinel lymph nodes and no clinical evidence of other lymph node involvement. This large randomized phase 3 clinical trial, which included more than 1,900 patients, compared the potential therapeutic benefit of SLNB plus the immediate removal of the remaining regional lymph nodes (called completion lymph node dissection, or CLND) with SNLB plus active surveillance, which included regular ultrasound examination of the remaining regional lymph nodes and treatment with CLND if signs of additional lymph node metastasis were detected. \n",
      "After a median follow-up of 43 months, patients who had undergone immediate CLND did not have better melanoma-specific survival than those who had undergone SLNB with CLND only if signs of additional lymph node metastasis appear (86% of participants in both groups had not died from melanoma at 3 years) (9). \n",

      "\t\t  tubules of the kidney.Renal cell cancer  (also called kidney cancer or renal cell adenocarcinoma) is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in  the lining of tubules (very small tubes) in the kidney.  There are 2  kidneys, one on each  side of the backbone, above the waist. Tiny tubules in the kidneys filter and clean the blood. They take out waste products and make urine. The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a ureter into the bladder. The bladder holds the urine until it passes through the urethra and leaves the body. EnlargeAnatomy of the male urinary system (left panel) and female urinary  system (right panel) showing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The inside of the left kidney shows the renal pelvis. An inset shows the renal tubules and urine. Also shown are the prostate and penis (left panel) and the uterus (right panel). Urine is made in the renal tubules and collects in the renal pelvis of each kidney. The urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder until it leaves the body through the urethra.Cancer that starts in the ureters or the renal pelvis (the part of the kidney that collects urine and drains it to the ureters) is different from renal cell cancer.  For more information, see Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter Treatment.Smoking and misuse of certain pain medicines can affect the risk of renal cell cancer.

A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.Urinalysis:  A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells.CT scan (CAT\n",

An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.Bone scan: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:Tissue.

The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  renal cell cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually cancerous renal cells. The disease is metastatic renal cell cancer, not bone cancer.Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.The following stages are used for renal cell cancer:Stage IEnlargeStage I kidney cancer. The tumor is 7 centimeters or smaller and is found in the kidney only.In stage I, the tumor is 7 centimeters or smaller and is found in the kidney only.Stage IIEnlargeStage II kidney cancer.

This led to an international multi-institutional validation of age 55 years as a cutoff for risk stratification in the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) staging system for well-differentiated thyroid cancer. This analysis of 9,484 patients was responsible for the change in age cutoff from 45 years  to 55 years in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition, using AJCC/UICC staging for well-differentiated thyroid cancer.[22]   The prognostic significance of lymph node status is controversial.

      "In thyroid cancer, cell type is an important determinant of prognosis and treatment.  The thyroid has two cell types: follicular cells and parafollicular C cells.

      " Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that most commonly affects infants and young children. The exact cause of neuroblastoma is unknown, but certain risk factors have been identified. These include inherited genetic mutations, premature birth, and ethnicity (African Americans have a higher incidence). However, the vast majority of individuals do not develop neuroblastoma, regardless of these factors. Therefore, it can be said that those who rarely develop neuroblastoma are typically healthy individuals without any identified risk factors for this disease.\n",

      "changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About NeuroblastomaRevised text to state that the incidence is 8.3 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years. Also added text to state that the overall incidence of neuroblastoma cases in the United States has remained stable (cited Campbell et al. as reference 9).Added text about the epidemiological trends in incidence and outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma between 2003 and 2019 based on the United States Cancer Statistics database and the National Program of Cancer Registries survival database.Added text to state that with increased availability of sequencing techniques, the spectrum of germline alterations seen in patients with neuroblastoma is expanding. For example, one study identified a series of 11 patients with germline pathogenic variants in SMARCA4 (cited Witkowski et al. as reference 29). Also added text to state that BARD1, ERCC2, CHEK2, and MSH3 were the genes in which variants were most commonly observed. Variants in BARD1, EZH2, ALK, PTCH1, and MSH3 were specifically enriched in patients with neuroblastoma, compared with controls.Genomic and Biological Features of NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that next-generation sequencing or  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to identify TERT alterations. One study identified TERT rearrangements by FISH in 6% of all patients with neuroblastic tumors regardless of risk group and in 12.4% of patients with high-risk neuroblastic tumors (cited Yu et al. as reference 42).Stage Information for NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that one study of 50 children with neuroblastoma evaluated the role of gadolinium contrast as part of magnetic resonance imaging scans. Assessment of tumor size and image-defined risk factors appeared similar regardless of whether gadolinium was used (cited Morin et al. as reference 13).Treatment of High-Risk NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that these more favorable outcomes for patients with stage 4N disease were confirmed in a single-institution study of 51 patients (cited Kushner et al. as reference 5).Added text to state that an updated report describes the results of a propensity matching analysis that compared patients who were treated with eflornithine with patients in  the ANBL0032 trial who were not treated with eflornithine (cited Oesterheld et al. as reference 57). Propensity matching generally balanced differences in available patient characteristics. In the matched analysis, patients in the eflornithine cohort had statistically significantly higher event-free survival and overall survival, compared with patients in the non-eflornithine cohort. The authors note that uncontrolled confounders may exist in this nonrandomized comparison. Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of eflornithine as continuation therapy in December 2023.This summary is written and maintained by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is\n",

      "Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of neuroblastoma. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.Reviewers and UpdatesThis summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:be discussed at a meeting,be cited with text, orreplace or update an existing article that is already cited.Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.The lead reviewers for Neuroblastoma Treatment are:Steven DuBois, MD, MS (Dana Farber Cancer Institute)Andrea A. Hayes-Dixon, MD, FACS, FAAP (Howard University)Karen J. Marcus, MD, FACR (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Hospital)Nita Louise Seibel, MD (National Cancer Institute)Stephen J.

Smith, MD, PhD (National Cancer Institute)Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's Email Us. Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.Levels of EvidenceSome of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board uses a formal evidence ranking system in developing its level-of-evidence designations.Permission to Use This SummaryPDQ is a registered trademark.

      "Go to Health Professional VersionKey PointsNeuroblastoma is a type of cancer that forms in neuroblasts (immature nerve tissue) in the adrenal glands, neck, chest, or spinal cord.Certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having neuroblastoma.Genetic testing can determine whether a child has an inherited form of neuroblastoma.Sometimes children with certain gene mutations should be checked for signs of neuroblastoma.Signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include bone pain or a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.Tests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to diagnose neuroblastoma.Getting a second opinion.Certain factors affect prognosis (chance\n",
      "\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that forms in neuroblasts (immature nerve tissue) in the adrenal glands, neck, chest, or spinal cord.Neuroblastoma often begins in the  nerve tissue of the adrenal glands. There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney in the back of the upper abdomen. The adrenal glands make important hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and the way the body reacts to stress. EnlargeNeuroblastoma may be found in the adrenal glands and paraspinal nerve tissue from the neck to the pelvis.Neuroblastoma most often begins in infancy. It is usually diagnosed between the first month of life and age 5 years. The tumor is found when it begins to grow and cause signs or symptoms. Sometimes it forms before birth and is found during an ultrasound of the baby.By the time cancer is diagnosed, it has usually metastasized (spread). Neuroblastoma spreads most often to the  lymph nodes, bones, bone marrow, liver, and skin in infants and children. Adolescents may also have metastasis to the lungs and brain.Certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having neuroblastoma.Neuroblastoma is caused by certain changes to the way neuroblast cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. There are many risk factors for neuroblastoma, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of DNA damage in cells that may lead to neuroblastoma. To learn more about how cancer develops, see What Is Cancer?A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors can be changed. Risk factors also include things people cannot change, like family history. It's important to learn about risk factors for neuroblastoma because it can help you make choices for screening for cancer.Possible risk factors for neuroblastoma include:Having certain changes in genes (ALK or PHOX2B).Having certain genetic conditions, such as:Costello syndromeNoonan syndromeneurofibromatosis type 1Li-Fraumeni syndromeBeckwith-Wiedemann syndromepheochromocytoma/paraganglioma syndromesROHHAD syndromes (rapid-onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysfunction)Having a strong family history of neuroblastoma.Genetic testing can determine whether a child has an inherited form of neuroblastoma.Gene mutations that increase the risk of neuroblastoma are sometimes inherited (passed from the parent to the child). In children with a gene mutation, neuroblastoma usually occurs at a younger age, and more than one tumor may form in the adrenal glands or in the nerve tissue in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis.It is not always clear from the family medical history whether a condition is inherited. Certain families may benefit from genetic counseling and genetic testing. Genetic counselors and other specially trained health professionals can discuss a child's diagnosis and the family's medical history to understand:their options for ALK or PHOX2B gene testingthe risk of neuroblastoma for the child and the child's siblingsthe risks and benefits of learning genetic informationGenetic counselors can also help parents cope with their child's genetic testing results, including how to discuss the results with family members.Once it is known that the child has an inherited form of neuroblastoma, other family members can be screened for the ALK or PHOX2B mutation.Sometimes children with certain gene mutations should be checked for signs of neuroblastoma.Children with certain gene mutations or hereditary (inherited)  syndromes should be checked for signs of neuroblastoma until they are 10 years old. The following tests may be used:Abdominal ultrasound: A test in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the abdomen and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of the abdomen called a sonogram.Urine catecholamine studies: A test in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher-than-normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma.Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.Talk to your child's doctor about how often these tests need to be done.Signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include bone pain or a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.The most common signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone.  Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:lump in the abdomen, neck, or chestbone painswollen stomach and trouble breathing  (in infants)bulging eyesdark circles around the eyes (\"black eyes\")painless, bluish lumps under the skin (in infants)weakness or paralysis (loss of ability to move a body part)Less common signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include the following:fevershortness of breathfeeling tiredeasy bruising or bleedingpetechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding)high blood pressuresevere watery diarrheaHorner syndrome (droopy eyelid, smaller pupil, and less sweating on one side of the face)jerky muscle movementsuncontrolled eye movementsThese and other signs and symptoms may be caused by neuroblastoma or by other conditions. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them as a first step in making a diagnosis.Tests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to diagnose neuroblastoma.If your child has symptoms that suggest neuroblastoma, their doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or another condition. They will ask about your child's personal and family medical history and do a physical exam.Depending on your child's symptoms and medical history and the results of their physical and neurological exam, the doctor may recommend more tests to find out if your child has neuroblastoma, and if so, its extent (stage). If neuroblastoma is diagnosed, the results of these tests and procedures will help you and your child's doctor make decisions about treatment.The following tests and procedures may be used:Urine catecholamine studies: A test in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher-than-normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma.Blood chemistry studies: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. A higher-than-normal amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be a sign of disease. Ferritin level: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of ferritin (a protein that stores iron in cells). A higher-than-normal amount may be a sign of disease.MIBG  scan: A procedure used to find  neuroendocrine tumors, such as neuroblastoma. A very small amount of a substance called radioactive MIBG is injected into a vein and travels through the  bloodstream.  Neuroendocrine tumor cells take up the radioactive MIBG and are detected by a scanner. Scans may be taken over 1-3 days. An iodine solution may be given before or during the test to keep the thyroid gland from absorbing too much of the MIBG. This test is also used to find out how well the tumor is responding to treatment. MIBG is also used in high doses to treat neuroblastoma.CT scan (CAT scan):  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  To learn more, see Computed Tomography (CT) Scans and Cancer.EnlargeComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into  a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).EnlargeMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This test will usually only be done if the tumor does not take up MIBG.X-ray of the chest or bone:  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.Ultrasound exam:  A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. An ultrasound exam is not done if a CT/MRI has been done.EnlargeAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).Tumor biopsy: Cells and tissues are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The way the biopsy is done depends on where the tumor is in the body. Sometimes the whole tumor is removed at the same time the biopsy is done. The doctor who reviews the tumor biopsy will determine if the tumor appears to have more favorable or unfavorable features. These features may affect treatment and survival.Children up to age 6 months may not need a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor because the tumor may disappear without treatment.Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. This test is also used to stage the tumor. EnlargeBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.Lymph node biopsy: The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the lymph node tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. This test is used to diagnose and stage the tumor. One of the following types of biopsies may be done:     \n",
      "    Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lymph node.Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lymph node.Core biopsy: The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid from a \n",
      "     lymph node using a thin needle.\n",
      "Light microscopy: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.Immunohistochemistry: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.Molecular testing:\n",
      "A molecular test checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or bone marrow. Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing neuroblastoma. A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, or make a prognosis.Children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma may be eligible for molecular testing through the Molecular Characterization Initiative.The Molecular Characterization Initiative offers free molecular testing to children, adolescents, and young adults with certain types of newly diagnosed cancer. The program is offered through NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. To learn more, visit About the Molecular Characterization Initiative.Biomarker testing: Biomarker testing is a way to look for genes, proteins, and other substances (called biomarkers or tumor markers) that can provide information about cancer. Some biomarkers affect how certain cancers behave and how certain treatments work. Biomarker testing may help your doctor choose a cancer treatment.To check for these biomarkers, samples of tissue containing neuroblastoma cells are removed during a biopsy or surgery and tested in a laboratory. Neuroblastoma biomarker testing includes:MYCN amplification study: A laboratory study in which cells in a sample of tumor or bone marrow are checked to see how many copies of the MYCN gene are in the tumor DNA. MYCN is important for cell growth. Having more than 10 copies of the gene is called MYCN amplification. Neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification is more likely to spread in the body and more likely to show rapid growth.ALK: The tumor cells may be checked in the laboratory for mutations or amplification (checking the number) of the ALK gene. These changes may increase the growth of cancer cells. Finding changes in the ALK gene in tumor tissue may lead to changes in the cancer treatment plan.Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which the number and structure of chromosomes of cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.  ALK or PHOX2B genetic tests: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for a change in the ALK gene or PHOX2B gene in normal cells.Getting a second opinion.Some people want to get a second opinion to confirm their child’s neuroblastoma diagnosis and treatment plan. If you choose to seek a second opinion, you will need to get important medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans before giving a recommendation. The doctor who gives the second opinion may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child’s cancer.To learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see Finding Cancer Care. You can contact NCI's Cancer Information Service via chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Cancer.Certain factors affect prognosis (chance\n",
      "\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.If your child has been diagnosed with neuroblastoma, you may have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis.The prognosis and treatment options depend on:age at the time of diagnosisthe child's risk groupwhether there are certain changes in the MYCN or ALK geneswhether the tumor is diploid or hyperdiploidwhether there are changes to the tumor chromosomesthe type of tumor neurotrophin receptorwhere in the body the tumor started (abdomen, chest, neck, or spine)the stage of the cancerlevels of LDH and ferritinhow the tumor responds to treatmenthow much time passed between diagnosis and when the cancer recurred (for recurrent cancer)Prognosis  and treatment options for neuroblastoma   are also affected by tumor histology, which includes: the patterns of the tumor cellshow different the tumor cells are from normal cellshow fast the tumor cells are growing The tumor histology is said to be favorable or unfavorable, depending on these factors. A child with favorable tumor histology has a better chance of recovery.In some children up to age 6 months, neuroblastoma may disappear without treatment. This is called spontaneous regression. The child is closely watched for signs or symptoms of neuroblastoma. If signs or symptoms occur, treatment may be needed.\n",

      "\t\t  if cancer has spread from  where it started to other parts of the body.\n",
      "\t\t  The process used to find out the extent or spread of cancer is called  staging. The information gathered from the staging process helps determine the stage of the disease. For neuroblastoma, the stage of disease affects whether the cancer is low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk. It also affects the treatment plan.      The results of some tests and procedures used to diagnose neuroblastoma may be used for staging. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures.The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS)Stage L1In stage L1, the cancer is in only one area, and there are no image-defined risk factors (IDRFs). IDRFs are found on MRI or CT scans done during diagnosis. IDRFs are used to determine the risk of surgery and the chance of completely removing the tumor.Stage L2In stage L2, the cancer is in one area, has not spread beyond nearby tissue, and there are one or more IDRFs.Stage MIn stage M, neuroblastoma has spread to areas far from the tumor. This does not include stage MS.Stage MSIn stage MS, children younger than 18 months have cancer that has spread to the skin, liver, and/or bone marrow.Treatment of neuroblastoma is  based on risk groups.  For many types of cancer, stages are used to plan treatment. For neuroblastoma, treatment depends on the patient's risk group. The risk group is determined by the following factors:the stage of the cancerthe child's age at diagnosisthe International Neuroblastoma Pathologic Classification (INPC) (tumor histology)whether the tumors are diploid or hyperdiploid (DNA index)if MYCN is found in the tumor cells.There are three risk groups: low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk.Low-risk and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma have a good chance of being cured.High-risk neuroblastoma may be hard to cure.For more information on the risk group classification, see the Revised International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) section in Neuroblastoma Treatment (Health Professional Version).Sometimes neuroblastoma does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.Refractory neuroblastoma is a tumor that does not respond to treatment.\n",

      " Schistosoma haematobium is a parasite that causes bladder infections, which is common in Africa and the Middle East but rare in the United States. The infection increases the risk of developing bladder cancer through several mechanisms:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Chronic inflammation: The parasitic infection leads to chronic inflammation in the bladder, which can damage the bladder tissue and promote the development of cancerous cells over time.\n",
      "2. Direct cellular transformation: Schistosoma haematobium eggs can directly interact with bladder epithelial cells, leading to genetic changes that contribute to the development of cancerous cells.\n",
      "3. Immune response: The immune response to the parasitic infection can also contribute to the development of bladder cancer. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the immune response can damage DNA and lead to mutations, ultimately contributing to the development of cancerous cells.\n",
      "4. Persistent infection: If left untreated, a Schistosoma haematobium infection can persist for many years, increasing the risk of developing bladder cancer over time.\n",
      "5. Co-infections: In areas where Schistosoma haematobium is endemic, there may be co-infections with other carcinogens or oncogenic viruses, which can further increase the risk of bladder cancer development.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that not all individuals infected with Schistosoma haematobium will develop bladder cancer, and the exact mechanisms by which the infection increases the risk are still being studied. However, prevention and early detection of both the parasitic infection and bladder cancer are crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions.\n",

      " What happens if a colorectal cancer screening test finds an abnormality?\n",
      "\n",
      "If a screening test finds an abnormality (a lesion or tumor), additional tests may be needed. These tests most often include a colonoscopy if it has not already been done, such as in the case of stool blood testing. If an abnormality is found during sigmoidoscopy, a biopsy or polypectomy may be performed during the test, and a follow-up colonoscopy may be recommended. If an abnormality is found during a standard colonoscopy, a biopsy or polypectomy may be performed during the test to determine whether cancer is present. If an abnormality is detected during virtual colonoscopy, the patient will be referred for a standard colonoscopy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What new tests are being developed for colorectal cancer screening?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Among new approaches to colorectal cancer screening that are being explored are ways to improve visualization of the colon. One technique is capsule colonoscopy (also called capsule endoscopy), in which a person swallows a pill-like capsule that contains a tiny wireless camera. The camera takes pictures of the inside of the digestive tract and sends them to a small recorder that is worn on the patient’s waist or shoulder. The pictures are then viewed on a computer by the doctor to check for signs of disease. The capsule passes out of the body during a bowel movement. Cleansing of the colon is still necessary before this test. This method is currently approved for patients with an incomplete colonoscopy and for detection of colon polyps in patients with evidence of lower GI bleeding but not as a stand-alone screening test. \n",
      "One new approach to colorectal cancer screening is to look for cells released by colorectal polyps and tumors into the bloodstream (24). These so-called circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare, however. Researchers have developed an ultrasensitive antibody-linked CTC detection technology to capture colorectal epithelial cells associated with colorectal tumors and adenomas in blood samples (25). In a proof-of-concept study, this blood-based CTC test was able to distinguish between patients with colorectal adenomas or cancer and people without cancer (26).\n",
      "Researchers have also identified small molecules, called metabolites, in urine that may signal the presence of colorectal polyps and tumors (27, 28). In a clinical study, a metabolomic-based urine test was better able to identify patients with adenomas than stool-based tests (29).\n",
      "Researchers are also trying to improve the sensitivity of stool-based screening for detecting advanced adenomatous polyps, which can potentially become colorectal cancer, by testing for the presence of multiple biomarkers. For example, measuring three protein biomarkers in stool—hemoglobin, calprotectin, and serpin family F member 2—improved the ability of FIT to detect advanced lesions (including colorectal cancer) by 35% without reducing its specificity (30).\n",
      "Information about ongoing clinical trials that are studying methods for colorectal cancer screening can be found in NCI’s clinical trials database. You may also contact NCI’s Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) for assistance with searching the clinical trials database.\n",

      " Bladder cancer occurs when cells in the bladder start to grow without control. The bladder is a hollow, balloon-shaped organ in the lower part of the abdomen that stores urine. The bladder has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger to store urine made by the kidneys and to shrink to squeeze urine out of the body. There are two kidneys, one on each side of the backbone, above the waist. The bladder and kidneys work together to remove toxins and wastes from your body through urine:Tiny tubules in the kidneys filter and clean the blood. These tubules take out waste products and make urine.The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a ureter into the bladder.The bladder holds the urine until it passes through a tube called the urethra and leaves the body.EnlargeAnatomy of the male urinary system (left panel) and female urinary  system (right panel) showing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The inside of the left kidney shows the renal pelvis. An inset shows the renal tubules and urine. Also shown are the prostate and penis (left panel) and the uterus (right panel). Urine is made in the renal tubules and collects in the renal pelvis of each kidney. The urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder until it leaves the body through the urethra.\n",

      "\n",
      "Types of bladder cancer\n",
      "Urothelial carcinoma     (also called transitional cell carcinoma) is cancer that begins in the urothelial cells, which line the urethra, bladder, ureters, renal pelvis, and some other organs. Almost all bladder cancers are urothelial carcinomas.Urothelial cells are also called transitional cells because they change shape. These cells are able to stretch when the bladder is full of urine and shrink when it is emptied. Other types of bladder cancer are rare:Squamous cell carcinoma is cancer that begins in squamous cells (thin, flat cells lining the inside of the bladder). This type of cancer may form after long-term irritation or infection with a tropical parasite called schistosomiasis, which is common in Africa and the Middle East but rare in the United States.  When chronic irritation occurs, transitional cells that line the bladder can gradually change to squamous cells. Adenocarcinoma is cancer that begins in glandular cells that are found in the lining of the bladder. Glandular cells in the bladder make mucus and other substances. Small cell carcinoma of the bladder is cancer that begins in neuroendocrine cells (nerve-like cells that release hormones into the blood in response to a signal from the nervous system).There are other ways to describe bladder cancer:Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is cancer that has not reached the muscle wall of the bladder. Most bladder cancers are non-muscle-invasive.Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is cancer that has spread through the lining of the bladder and into the muscle wall of the bladder or beyond it.\n"

      " Fetal and neonatal neuroblastoma are types of cancer that originate from immature nerve cells (neuroblasts) in the adrenal glands or sympathetic nervous system. While neuroblastoma can be diagnosed before birth, it is more commonly detected after birth, often during routine screening or when symptoms appear. In some cases, fetal or neonatal neuroblastomas may undergo spontaneous regression without any treatment intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observation of Spontaneous Regression:\n",
      "Spontaneous regression refers to the disappearance of a tumor without any external intervention such as surgery or chemotherapy. The exact mechanism behind spontaneous regression in fetal and neonatal neuroblastoma is not well understood, but it has been observed in some cases. According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, approximately 10% of infants with stage 4S neuroblastoma (a low-risk subtype) experience spontaneous regression without any treatment intervention (Twist et al., 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "Prognostic Factors:\n",
      "The prognosis for fetal and neonatal neuroblastoma varies depending on several factors, including the age of the patient, tumor stage, MYCN gene amplification status, and histology. However, some studies suggest that certain factors may be associated with a higher likelihood of spontaneous regression in infants with neuroblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Age: Infants diagnosed with neuroblastoma before the age of 30 days have a higher chance of experiencing spontaneous regression (Canete et al., 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tumor Stage: Neuroblastomas that are limited to one part of the body (localized) or have spread only to the liver, skin, or bone marrow (stage 4S) are more likely to undergo spontaneous regression (Guglielmi et al., 1996; Nickerson et al., 2000).\n",
      "\n",
      "MYCN Gene Amplification: Infants with neuroblastoma that do not have amplified MYCN genes have a higher likelihood of experiencing spontaneous regression (De Bernardi et al., 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "Histology: Neuroblastomas with favorable histology, such as ganglioneuromatosis or ganglioneuroma, are more likely to undergo spontaneous regression (Steele et al., 2013).\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment Implications:\n",
      "The observation of spontaneous regression in fetal and neonatal neuroblastoma has important implications for treatment decisions. Infants with low-risk features, such as those described above, may be observed without immediate intervention, while those with high-risk features are typically treated aggressively with chemotherapy, surgery, or a combination of both (Irwin et al., 2021).\n",

      " Adverse Effects\n",
      "Serious adverse effects of acupuncture are rare.  Reported accidents and infections appear to be related to violations of sterile procedure, negligence of the practitioner, or both.[1,2] A systematic review of case reports on the safety of acupuncture, involving 98 papers published in the English language from 22 countries during the period from 1965 to 1999, found only 202 incidents. The number of incidents appeared to decline as training standards and licensure requirements were enhanced. Among the 118 (60%) reported incidents involving infection, 94 (80%) involved hepatitis, occurring mainly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Very few hepatitis or other infections associated with acupuncture have been reported since 1988, when widespread use of disposable needles was introduced and national certification requirements for clean-needle techniques were developed and enforced as an acupuncture licensure requirement.[3,4] Because cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy are immunocompromised,  precautions must be taken and strict clean-needle techniques must be applied when acupuncture treatment is given.[5] Minor adverse effects of acupuncture such as the following, have been reported:Pain at needling sites.Hematoma.Tiredness.Lightheadedness.Drowsiness.Localized skin irritation.These minor adverse effects can be minimized by appropriate patient management, including local pressing and massage at the needling site after treatment.[6,7] ReferencesLao L: Acupuncture techniques and devices.

      "Summary of the Evidence for Acupuncture Treatment of Cancer-Related Symptoms\n",
      "To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for cancer, the strength of the evidence (i.e., the levels of\n",
      "evidence) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever\n",
      "possible.  To qualify for a level of evidence analysis, a study must:Be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.Report on a therapeutic outcome or outcomes, such as tumor response, improvement in survival, or measured improvement in quality of life.Describe clinical findings in sufficient detail that a meaningful evaluation can be made.Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., endpoints) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For an explanation of the scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis, see the Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.It is noteworthy that almost all reported clinical studies on the effects of acupuncture on cancer or cancer therapy–related symptoms focus on symptom management rather than the disease itself. Investigations into the effects of acupuncture on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, many of which were randomized and well-controlled, produced the most convincing findings.  A number of randomized controlled trials have reported on the effect of acupuncture in alleviating other cancer treatment-associated side effects, with many showing promising evidence supporting the use of acupuncture.  Additional phase III clinical trials are ongoing.  \n",

      "Go to Health Professional VersionKey PointsNeuroblastoma is a type of cancer that forms in neuroblasts (immature nerve tissue) in the adrenal glands, neck, chest, or spinal cord.Certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having neuroblastoma.Genetic testing can determine whether a child has an inherited form of neuroblastoma.Sometimes children with certain gene mutations should be checked for signs of neuroblastoma.Signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include bone pain or a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.Tests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to diagnose neuroblastoma.Getting a second opinion.Certain factors affect prognosis (chance\n",
      "\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that forms in neuroblasts (immature nerve tissue) in the adrenal glands, neck, chest, or spinal cord.Neuroblastoma often begins in the  nerve tissue of the adrenal glands. There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney in the back of the upper abdomen. The adrenal glands make important hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and the way the body reacts to stress. EnlargeNeuroblastoma may be found in the adrenal glands and paraspinal nerve tissue from the neck to the pelvis.Neuroblastoma most often begins in infancy. It is usually diagnosed between the first month of life and age 5 years. The tumor is found when it begins to grow and cause signs or symptoms. Sometimes it forms before birth and is found during an ultrasound of the baby.By the time cancer is diagnosed, it has usually metastasized (spread). Neuroblastoma spreads most often to the  lymph nodes, bones, bone marrow, liver, and skin in infants and children. Adolescents may also have metastasis to the lungs and brain.Certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having neuroblastoma.Neuroblastoma is caused by certain changes to the way neuroblast cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. There are many risk factors for neuroblastoma, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of DNA damage in cells that may lead to neuroblastoma. To learn more about how cancer develops, see What Is Cancer?A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors can be changed. Risk factors also include things people cannot change, like family history. It's important to learn about risk factors for neuroblastoma because it can help you make choices for screening for cancer.Possible risk factors for neuroblastoma include:Having certain changes in genes (ALK or PHOX2B).Having certain genetic conditions, such as:Costello syndromeNoonan syndromeneurofibromatosis type 1Li-Fraumeni syndromeBeckwith-Wiedemann syndromepheochromocytoma/paraganglioma syndromesROHHAD syndromes (rapid-onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysfunction)Having a strong family history of neuroblastoma.Genetic testing can determine whether a child has an inherited form of neuroblastoma.Gene mutations that increase the risk of neuroblastoma are sometimes inherited (passed from the parent to the child). In children with a gene mutation, neuroblastoma usually occurs at a younger age, and more than one tumor may form in the adrenal glands or in the nerve tissue in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis.It is not always clear from the family medical history whether a condition is inherited. Certain families may benefit from genetic counseling and genetic testing. Genetic counselors and other specially trained health professionals can discuss a child's diagnosis and the family's medical history to understand:their options for ALK or PHOX2B gene testingthe risk of neuroblastoma for the child and the child's siblingsthe risks and benefits of learning genetic informationGenetic counselors can also help parents cope with their child's genetic testing results, including how to discuss the results with family members.Once it is known that the child has an inherited form of neuroblastoma, other family members can be screened for the ALK or PHOX2B mutation.Sometimes children with certain gene mutations should be checked for signs of neuroblastoma.Children with certain gene mutations or hereditary (inherited)  syndromes should be checked for signs of neuroblastoma until they are 10 years old. The following tests may be used:Abdominal ultrasound: A test in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the abdomen and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of the abdomen called a sonogram.Urine catecholamine studies: A test in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher-than-normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma.Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.Talk to your child's doctor about how often these tests need to be done.Signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include bone pain or a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.The most common signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone.  Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:lump in the abdomen, neck, or chestbone painswollen stomach and trouble breathing  (in infants)bulging eyesdark circles around the eyes (\"black eyes\")painless, bluish lumps under the skin (in infants)weakness or paralysis (loss of ability to move a body part)Less common signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include the following:fevershortness of breathfeeling tiredeasy bruising or bleedingpetechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding)high blood pressuresevere watery diarrheaHorner syndrome (droopy eyelid, smaller pupil, and less sweating on one side of the face)jerky muscle movementsuncontrolled eye movementsThese and other signs and symptoms may be caused by neuroblastoma or by other conditions. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them as a first step in making a diagnosis.Tests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to diagnose neuroblastoma.If your child has symptoms that suggest neuroblastoma, their doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or another condition. They will ask about your child's personal and family medical history and do a physical exam.Depending on your child's symptoms and medical history and the results of their physical and neurological exam, the doctor may recommend more tests to find out if your child has neuroblastoma, and if so, its extent (stage). If neuroblastoma is diagnosed, the results of these tests and procedures will help you and your child's doctor make decisions about treatment.The following tests and procedures may be used:Urine catecholamine studies: A test in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher-than-normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma.Blood chemistry studies: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. A higher-than-normal amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be a sign of disease. Ferritin level: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of ferritin (a protein that stores iron in cells). A higher-than-normal amount may be a sign of disease.MIBG  scan: A procedure used to find  neuroendocrine tumors, such as neuroblastoma. A very small amount of a substance called radioactive MIBG is injected into a vein and travels through the  bloodstream.  Neuroendocrine tumor cells take up the radioactive MIBG and are detected by a scanner. Scans may be taken over 1-3 days. An iodine solution may be given before or during the test to keep the thyroid gland from absorbing too much of the MIBG. This test is also used to find out how well the tumor is responding to treatment. MIBG is also used in high doses to treat neuroblastoma.CT scan (CAT scan):  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  To learn more, see Computed Tomography (CT) Scans and Cancer.EnlargeComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into  a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).EnlargeMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This test will usually only be done if the tumor does not take up MIBG.X-ray of the chest or bone:  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.Ultrasound exam:  A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. An ultrasound exam is not done if a CT/MRI has been done.EnlargeAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).Tumor biopsy: Cells and tissues are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The way the biopsy is done depends on where the tumor is in the body. Sometimes the whole tumor is removed at the same time the biopsy is done. The doctor who reviews the tumor biopsy will determine if the tumor appears to have more favorable or unfavorable features. These features may affect treatment and survival.Children up to age 6 months may not need a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor because the tumor may disappear without treatment.Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. This test is also used to stage the tumor. EnlargeBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.Lymph node biopsy: The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the lymph node tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. This test is used to diagnose and stage the tumor. One of the following types of biopsies may be done:     \n",
      "    Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lymph node.Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lymph node.Core biopsy: The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid from a \n",
      "     lymph node using a thin needle.\n",
      "Light microscopy: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.Immunohistochemistry: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.Molecular testing:\n",
      "A molecular test checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or bone marrow. Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing neuroblastoma. A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, or make a prognosis.Children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma may be eligible for molecular testing through the Molecular Characterization Initiative.The Molecular Characterization Initiative offers free molecular testing to children, adolescents, and young adults with certain types of newly diagnosed cancer. The program is offered through NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. To learn more, visit About the Molecular Characterization Initiative.Biomarker testing: Biomarker testing is a way to look for genes, proteins, and other substances (called biomarkers or tumor markers) that can provide information about cancer. Some biomarkers affect how certain cancers behave and how certain treatments work. Biomarker testing may help your doctor choose a cancer treatment.To check for these biomarkers, samples of tissue containing neuroblastoma cells are removed during a biopsy or surgery and tested in a laboratory. Neuroblastoma biomarker testing includes:MYCN amplification study: A laboratory study in which cells in a sample of tumor or bone marrow are checked to see how many copies of the MYCN gene are in the tumor DNA. MYCN is important for cell growth. Having more than 10 copies of the gene is called MYCN amplification. Neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification is more likely to spread in the body and more likely to show rapid growth.ALK: The tumor cells may be checked in the laboratory for mutations or amplification (checking the number) of the ALK gene. These changes may increase the growth of cancer cells. Finding changes in the ALK gene in tumor tissue may lead to changes in the cancer treatment plan.Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which the number and structure of chromosomes of cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.  ALK or PHOX2B genetic tests: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for a change in the ALK gene or PHOX2B gene in normal cells.Getting a second opinion.Some people want to get a second opinion to confirm their child’s neuroblastoma diagnosis and treatment plan. If you choose to seek a second opinion, you will need to get important medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans before giving a recommendation. The doctor who gives the second opinion may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child’s cancer.To learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see Finding Cancer Care. You can contact NCI's Cancer Information Service via chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Cancer.Certain factors affect prognosis (chance\n",
      "\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.If your child has been diagnosed with neuroblastoma, you may have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis.The prognosis and treatment options depend on:age at the time of diagnosisthe child's risk groupwhether there are certain changes in the MYCN or ALK geneswhether the tumor is diploid or hyperdiploidwhether there are changes to the tumor chromosomesthe type of tumor neurotrophin receptorwhere in the body the tumor started (abdomen, chest, neck, or spine)the stage of the cancerlevels of LDH and ferritinhow the tumor responds to treatmenthow much time passed between diagnosis and when the cancer recurred (for recurrent cancer)Prognosis  and treatment options for neuroblastoma   are also affected by tumor histology, which includes: the patterns of the tumor cellshow different the tumor cells are from normal cellshow fast the tumor cells are growing The tumor histology is said to be favorable or unfavorable, depending on these factors. A child with favorable tumor histology has a better chance of recovery.In some children up to age 6 months, neuroblastoma may disappear without treatment. This is called spontaneous regression. The child is closely watched for signs or symptoms of neuroblastoma. If signs or symptoms occur, treatment may be needed.\n"

      " Women who take oral contraceptives (OCs) and those who don't differ in various ways that might influence their cancer risks beyond OC use alone. Some of these differences include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Age: Women who start using OCs are generally younger than those who don't, as they begin taking them for contraceptive purposes. Younger women have a lower overall risk of developing certain cancers, such as endometrial cancer, due to their younger age and hormonal status.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Lifestyle factors: Women who use OCs may have different lifestyle habits compared to those who don't. For instance, they might be more likely to smoke or engage in less physical activity, which are known risk factors for certain cancers like lung cancer and breast cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Parity (number of children): Women who take OCs for extended periods may delay starting a family or have fewer children compared to those who don't use OCs. Some studies suggest that having children, especially at an older age, might protect against certain cancers like endometrial cancer and breast cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Socioeconomic status: Women who use OCs may come from different socioeconomic backgrounds than those who don't. For example, they might have higher education levels or income, which could influence their access to healthcare services and cancer screening, ultimately impacting their cancer risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Family history: Women with a family history of certain cancers might be more likely to use OCs as a preventive measure against those cancers. For instance, women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer might take OCs to reduce their risk. However, this could also mean that they have a higher baseline risk due to their family history, which could influence the observed cancer risks associated with OC use.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Hormonal factors: Women who use OCs are exposed to exogenous hormones (estrogen and progestin) for extended periods, which might impact their cancer risks differently than those who don't use OCs. For example, the use of OCs is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer but a decreased risk of ovarian cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Genetic factors: Women who use OCs might have different genetic susceptibilities to various cancers compared to those who don't. For instance, women with certain genetic mutations (BRCA1/2) might be more likely to develop breast or ovarian cancer regardless of their OC use.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Cancer screening: Women who use OCs might have different patterns of cancer screening than those who don't. For example, they might be less likely to undergo regular mammography due to concerns about radiation exposure while using hormonal contraceptives. This could impact the observed cancer risks associated with OC use.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, women who take oral contraceptives differ from those who don't in various ways that might influence their cancer risks beyond OC use alone. These differences include age, lifestyle factors, parity, socioeconomic status, family history, hormonal factors, and genetic factors. Understanding these differences is crucial for interpreting the observed associations between oral contraceptive use and cancer risk accurately.\n",

      "changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About NeuroblastomaRevised text to state that the incidence is 8.3 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years. Also added text to state that the overall incidence of neuroblastoma cases in the United States has remained stable (cited Campbell et al. as reference 9).Added text about the epidemiological trends in incidence and outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma between 2003 and 2019 based on the United States Cancer Statistics database and the National Program of Cancer Registries survival database.Added text to state that with increased availability of sequencing techniques, the spectrum of germline alterations seen in patients with neuroblastoma is expanding. For example, one study identified a series of 11 patients with germline pathogenic variants in SMARCA4 (cited Witkowski et al. as reference 29). Also added text to state that BARD1, ERCC2, CHEK2, and MSH3 were the genes in which variants were most commonly observed. Variants in BARD1, EZH2, ALK, PTCH1, and MSH3 were specifically enriched in patients with neuroblastoma, compared with controls.Genomic and Biological Features of NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that next-generation sequencing or  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to identify TERT alterations. One study identified TERT rearrangements by FISH in 6% of all patients with neuroblastic tumors regardless of risk group and in 12.4% of patients with high-risk neuroblastic tumors (cited Yu et al. as reference 42).Stage Information for NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that one study of 50 children with neuroblastoma evaluated the role of gadolinium contrast as part of magnetic resonance imaging scans. Assessment of tumor size and image-defined risk factors appeared similar regardless of whether gadolinium was used (cited Morin et al. as reference 13).Treatment of High-Risk NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that these more favorable outcomes for patients with stage 4N disease were confirmed in a single-institution study of 51 patients (cited Kushner et al. as reference 5).Added text to state that an updated report describes the results of a propensity matching analysis that compared patients who were treated with eflornithine with patients in  the ANBL0032 trial who were not treated with eflornithine (cited Oesterheld et al. as reference 57). Propensity matching generally balanced differences in available patient characteristics. In the matched analysis, patients in the eflornithine cohort had statistically significantly higher event-free survival and overall survival, compared with patients in the non-eflornithine cohort. The authors note that uncontrolled confounders may exist in this nonrandomized comparison. Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of eflornithine as continuation therapy in December 2023.This summary is written and maintained by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is\n",

      "Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of neuroblastoma. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.Reviewers and UpdatesThis summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:be discussed at a meeting,be cited with text, orreplace or update an existing article that is already cited.Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.The lead reviewers for Neuroblastoma Treatment are:Steven DuBois, MD, MS (Dana Farber Cancer Institute)Andrea A. Hayes-Dixon, MD, FACS, FAAP (Howard University)Karen J. Marcus, MD, FACR (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Hospital)Nita Louise Seibel, MD (National Cancer Institute)Stephen J.

      "Go to Health Professional VersionKey PointsReligious and spiritual values are important to patients coping with cancer.Spirituality and religion may have different meanings.Serious illness, such as cancer, may cause spiritual distress. Religious and spiritual values are important to patients coping with cancer.Studies have shown that religious and spiritual values are important to   Americans. Most American adults say that they believe in God and that their  religious beliefs affect how they live their lives. However, people have different ideas about life after death, belief in miracles,  and other religious beliefs. Such beliefs may be based on  gender, education, and ethnic background. Many patients with cancer  rely on spiritual or religious beliefs and practices to help them cope with their disease.  This is called spiritual coping. Many caregivers also  rely on spiritual coping.   Each person may have different spiritual needs, depending on cultural and religious traditions. For some seriously ill patients, spiritual well-being may affect how much anxiety they feel about death. For others, it may affect what  they decide about end-of-life treatments. Some patients and their family caregivers may want doctors to talk about spiritual concerns, but may feel unsure about how to bring up the subject. Some studies show that  doctors' support of spiritual well-being in very ill patients  helps improve their   quality of life.  Health care providers  who treat patients coping with cancer are looking at new ways to   help them with religious and spiritual concerns. Doctors may  ask patients which  spiritual issues  are important to them during treatment as well as near the end of life. When patients with advanced cancer receive spiritual support from the medical team, they may be more likely to choose hospice care and less aggressive treatment at the end of life. (See the PDQ summary on Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer for information on end-of-life issues.)Spirituality and religion may have different meanings.\n",
      "The terms spirituality and religion are often used in place of each other, but for many people they have different meanings. Religion may be defined as a specific set of beliefs and practices, usually within an organized group. Spirituality may be defined as an individual's sense of peace, purpose, and connection to others, and beliefs about the meaning of life. Spirituality may be found and expressed through an organized religion or in other ways. Patients may think of themselves as spiritual or religious or both. \n",
      "\n",
      "Serious illness, such as cancer, may cause spiritual distress. Serious illnesses like cancer may cause patients or family caregivers to have doubts about their beliefs or religious values and cause much  spiritual distress.  Some studies show that patients with cancer may feel that they are being punished by God or may have a loss of faith after being diagnosed. Other patients may have mild feelings of spiritual distress when coping with cancer.This summary is about spirituality and religion in adults with cancer.\n",

      "Spirituality and Quality of Life\n",
      "Key PointsSpiritual and religious well-being  may help improve quality of life.Spiritual distress may also affect health.Spiritual and religious well-being  may help improve quality of life.It is not known for sure how spirituality and religion are related to health. Some studies show that spiritual or religious beliefs and practices create a positive mental attitude that may help a patient feel better and improve the well-being of  family caregivers. Spiritual and religious well-being  may help  improve health and quality of life in the following ways: Decrease anxiety, depression,  anger, and discomfort.Decrease the sense of isolation (feeling alone) and the risk of suicide.Decrease alcohol and drug abuse.Lower blood pressure and the risk of heart disease.Help the patient adjust to the effects of cancer and its treatment.Increase the ability to enjoy life during cancer treatment.Give a feeling of personal growth as a result of living with cancer.Increase positive feelings, including:Hope and optimism.Freedom from regret.Satisfaction with life.A sense of inner peace.Spiritual and religious well-being may also help a patient live longer.Spiritual distress may also affect health.Spiritual distress may make it harder for patients to cope with cancer and cancer treatment. Health care providers may encourage patients to meet with experienced spiritual or religious leaders to help deal with their spiritual issues. This may improve their health, quality of life, and ability to cope.\n",

      "Key PointsA spiritual assessment may help the doctor understand how religious or spiritual beliefs will affect the way a  patient copes with cancer.A spiritual assessment explores religious  beliefs and spiritual practices. A spiritual assessment may help the doctor understand how religious or spiritual beliefs will affect the way a  patient copes with cancer.A spiritual assessment is a method or tool used by doctors to understand  the role that religious and spiritual beliefs have in the patient's life. This may help the doctor understand how these beliefs affect the way the patient responds to the cancer diagnosis and decisions about cancer treatment. Some doctors or caregivers may wait for the patient to bring up spiritual concerns. Others may use  an  interview or a questionnaire.A spiritual assessment explores religious  beliefs and spiritual practices. A spiritual assessment may include questions about  the following:Religious denomination, if any.Beliefs or philosophy of life.Important spiritual practices or rituals.Using spirituality or religion as a source of strength.Being part of  a community of support.Using prayer or meditation.Loss of faith.Conflicts between spiritual or religious beliefs and cancer treatments.Ways that health care providers and caregivers may help with the patient's spiritual needs.Concerns about death and  afterlife.Planning for the end of life. (See the PDQ summary on Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer for information on end-of-life planning).The health care team may not ask about every issue the patient feels is important. Patients should bring up other spiritual or religious issues that they think may affect their cancer care.\n",

      "Meeting the Patient's Spiritual and Religious Needs\n",
      "Key PointsTo help patients with  spiritual needs during cancer care, medical staff will listen to  the wishes of the patient.The health care team will help with a patient's spiritual needs when setting goals and planning treatment.To help patients with  spiritual needs during cancer care, medical staff will listen to  the wishes of the patient.Spirituality and religion are very personal issues. Patients should expect doctors and caregivers to respect their religious and spiritual beliefs and concerns.   Patients with cancer who rely on spirituality to cope with the disease should be able to count on the health care team to give them  support. This may include giving patients information about people or groups that can help with spiritual or religious needs. Most hospitals have chaplains, but not all outpatient settings do. Patients who do not want to discuss spirituality during cancer care should also be able to count on the health care team to respect  their wishes.Doctors and  caregivers will try to respond to their patients' concerns,  but may not take part in patients' religious practices or discuss specific religious beliefs.The health care team will help with a patient's spiritual needs when setting goals and planning treatment.The health care team may help with a patient's spiritual needs in the following ways:Suggest goals and options for care that honor the patient's spiritual and/or religious views.Support the patient's use of spiritual coping during the illness.Encourage the patient to speak with his/her religious or spiritual leader.Refer the patient  to a hospital chaplain or support group that can help with spiritual issues during illness.Refer the patient  to other therapies that have been shown to increase spiritual well-being. These include mindfulness relaxation, such as yoga or meditation, or  creative arts programs, such as writing, drawing, or music therapy.\n",

      "About PDQPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about religious and spiritual coping in cancer care.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.Reviewers and UpdatesEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\n",

      "Clinical Trial InformationA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n",
      "Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).\n",

      "Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) are hormone-containing medications that are taken by mouth to prevent pregnancy. They prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation and also by preventing sperm from penetrating through the cervix.\n",
      "By far the most commonly prescribed type of oral contraceptive in the United States contains synthetic versions of the natural female hormones estrogen and progesterone. This type of birth control pill is often called a combined oral contraceptive. Another type of oral contraceptive, sometimes called the mini pill, contains only progestin, which is a man-made version of progesterone.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is known about the relationship between oral contraceptive use and cancer?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly all the research on the link between oral contraceptives and cancer risk comes from observational studies, both large prospective cohort studies and population-based case–control studies. Data from observational studies cannot definitively establish that an exposure—in this case, oral contraceptives—causes (or prevents) cancer. That is because women who take oral contraceptives may differ from those who don’t take them in ways other than their oral contraceptive use, and it is possible that these other differences—rather than oral contraceptive use—are what explains their different cancer risk.\n",
      "Overall, however, these studies have provided consistent evidence that the risks of breast and cervical cancers are increased in women who use oral contraceptives, whereas the risks of endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancers are reduced (1–3).\n",
      "Breast cancer: An analysis of data from more than 150,000 women who participated in 54 epidemiologic studies showed that, overall, women who had ever used oral contraceptives had a slight (7%) increase in the risk of breast cancer compared with women who had never used oral contraceptives. Women who were currently using oral contraceptives had a 24% increase in risk that did not increase with the duration of use. Risk declined after use of oral contraceptives stopped, and no risk increase was evident by 10 years after use had stopped (4).\n",
      "\tA 2010 analysis of data from the Nurses’ Health Study, which has been following more than 116,000 female nurses who were 24 to 43 years old when they enrolled in the study in 1989, also found that participants who used oral contraceptives had a slight increase in breast cancer risk (5, 6). However, nearly all of the increased risk was seen among women who took a specific type of oral contraceptive, a “triphasic” pill, in which the dose of hormones is changed in three stages over the course of a woman’s monthly cycle. An elevated risk associated with specific triphasic formulations was also reported in a nested case–control study that used electronic medical records to verify oral contraceptive use (7).\n",
      "\tIn 2017, a large prospective Danish study reported breast cancer risks associated with more recent formulations of oral contraceptives (8). Overall, women who were using or had recently stopped using oral combined hormone contraceptives had a modest (about 20%) increase in the risk of breast cancer compared with women who had never used oral contraceptives. The risk increase varied from 0% to 60%, depending on the specific type of oral combined hormone contraceptive. The risk of breast cancer also increased the longer oral contraceptives were used.\n",
      "\t \n",
      "Cervical cancer: Women who have used oral contraceptives for 5 or more years have a higher risk of cervical cancer than women who have never used oral contraceptives. The longer a woman uses oral contraceptives, the greater the increase in her risk of cervical cancer. One study found a 10% increased risk for less than 5 years of use, a 60% increased risk with 5–9 years of use, and a doubling of the risk with 10 or more years of use (9). However, the risk of cervical cancer has been found to decline over time after women stop using oral contraceptives (10–12).\n",
      "Endometrial cancer: Women who have ever used oral contraceptives have a lower risk of endometrial cancer than women who have never used oral contraceptives. Risk is reduced by at least 30%, with a greater risk reduction the longer oral contraceptives were used (13). The protective effect persists for many years after a woman stops using oral contraceptives (12, 14, 15). An analysis of women participating in the prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study found that the risk reduction was especially pronounced in long-time users of oral contraceptives who were smokers, had obesity, or exercised rarely (13).\n",
      "\t  \n",
      "Ovarian cancer: Women who have ever used oral contraceptives have a 30% to 50% lower risk of ovarian cancer than women who have never used oral contraceptives (16–18). This protection has been found to increase with the length of time oral contraceptives are used (13) and to continue for up to 30 years after a woman stops using oral contraceptives (17). A reduction in ovarian cancer risk with use of oral contraceptives is also seen among women who carry a harmful mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene (19–21).\n",
      "\t \n",
      "Colorectal cancer: Oral contraceptive use is associated with 15% to 20% lower risks of colorectal cancer (12, 14, 22, 23).\n",

However, some studies mentioned in the context suggest that older patients with NSCLC may have poorer outcomes compared to younger patients. For instance, Albain et al. reported reduced lung-cancer mortality in older patients who received chemotherapy, but their survival was still shorter than that of younger patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding treatment options, the context mentions that surgical resection is a common treatment for early-stage NSCLC (stages I and II). However, the suitability of surgery depends on various factors, including age, overall health, and tumor location. Older patients may not be good candidates for surgery due to comorbidities or functional limitations. In such cases, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these modalities may be considered as alternative treatment options.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context also mentions that the new international staging system (AJCC 8th edition) has been adopted for classifying NSCLC based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis. This system helps in determining the most appropriate treatment strategy for individual patients. For instance, stage II NSCLC may be treated with surgery or chemotherapy/radiation therapy depending on the patient's age, overall health, and other factors.\n",

The following results have been reported in clinical trials:Mature results of prospective randomized trials suggest that combined-modality therapy produces a modest but significant improvement in survival of 5% at 3 years compared with chemotherapy alone.[1-3][Level of evidence A1]Clinical trials have consistently achieved median survivals of 18 to 24 months and 2-year survival rates of 40% to 50%, with a treatment-related mortality rate of less than 3%.[3-7][Level of evidence A1]No consistent survival benefit has resulted from the following:[8-16]Increased dose intensity.Increased dose density.Administration of additional drugs or other (non–etoposide-containing) platinum-based combination regimens.Altered modes of administration of various chemotherapeutic agents.Maintenance chemotherapy.Length of treatment. The optimal duration of chemotherapy for patients with LD SCLC is not clearly defined, but no improvement exists in survival after the duration of drug administration exceeds 3 to 6 months. The preponderance of evidence available from randomized trials indicates that maintenance chemotherapy does not prolong survival for patients with LD SCLC.[8-15][Level of evidence A1]Dose and timing. The optimal dose and timing of TRT remain controversial.Multiple clinical trials and meta-analyses addressing the timing of TRT have been published, with the weight of evidence suggesting a small benefit to early TRT (i.e., TRT administered during the first or second cycle of chemotherapy administration).[3-6,8,9,15,17-20][Level of evidence A1]The amount of time from start to completion of TRT in LD SCLC may also affect overall survival (OS). In an analysis of four trials, the completion of therapy in less than 30 days was associated with an improved 5-year survival rate (relative risk,  0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49–0.80; P = .0003).[20][Level of evidence A1]Both once-daily and twice-daily chest radiation schedules have been used in regimens with etoposide and cisplatin.One randomized study showed a modest survival advantage in favor of twice-daily radiation therapy given for 3 weeks, compared with once-daily radiation therapy to 45 Gy given for 5 weeks (26% vs. 16% at 5 years; P = .04).[17][Level of evidence A1] Esophagitis was increased with twice-daily treatment. The phase III CONVERT study (NCT00433563) randomly assigned patients to receive either 45 Gy radiation therapy in 30 twice-daily fractions of 1.5 Gy over 19 days or 66 Gy in 33 once-daily fractions of 2 Gy over 45 days, starting on day 22 after commencing cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy (given as four to six cycles every 3 weeks in both groups).[21] The primary end point was OS, defined as time from randomization until death from any cause, analyzed by modified intention-to-treat. A 12% higher OS at 2 years in the once-daily group versus the twice-daily group was considered clinically significant to show superiority of the once-daily regimen.At a median follow-up of 45 months (interquartile range [IQR], 35–58), median OS was 30 months (95% CI, 24–34) in the twice-daily group versus 25 months (95% CI, 21–31) in the once-daily group (hazard ratio for death in the once-daily group, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.95–1.45]; P = .14).The two-year OS rate was 56% (95% CI, 50%–62%) in the twice-daily group and 51% (45%–57%) in the once-daily group (absolute difference between the treatment groups, 5.3% [95% CI, -3.2% to 13.7%]).Most toxicities were similar between the groups, except there was significantly more grade 4 neutropenia with twice-daily radiation therapy (129 [49%] vs. 101 [38%]; P = .05). In contrast to the earlier study, there was no difference between the groups in terms of rates of grade 3 to 4 esophagitis or pneumonitis. Twice-daily radiation therapy has not been broadly adopted. Once-daily fractions to doses higher than 60 Gy are feasible and commonly used; their clinical benefits are yet to be defined in phase III trials.[21][Level of evidence A1]Combination chemotherapy alonePatients with a contraindication to radiation therapy may receive chemotherapy alone. Patients presenting with superior vena cava syndrome are treated immediately with combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both, depending on the severity of presentation.[22,23] For more information, see Cardiopulmonary Syndromes.Surgery followed by chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapyThe role of surgery in the management of patients with SCLC is unproven.  Small case series and population studies have reported favorable outcomes for the  minority of LD patients with very limited disease, with small  tumors pathologically confined to the lung of origin or  the lung and ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes from surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy.[24-28][Level of evidence C2] Patients who have undergone surgery and then been diagnosed with SCLC generally receive adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. In patients who receive chemotherapy with radiation therapy, there is no improvement in survival with the addition of surgery.[28][Level of evidence C2] Given the absence of data from randomized trials, the potential benefits and risks of surgery in the management of individual patients with SCLC must be considered.Evidence (role of surgery):A randomized study evaluated the role of surgery in addition to chemoradiation therapy for 328 patients with LD SCLC. The study found no OS benefit with the addition of pulmonary resection.[29][Level of evidence A1]PCIPatients who have achieved a complete remission may receive PCI. Patients whose cancer can be controlled outside the brain have a 60% actuarial risk of developing central nervous system (CNS) metastases within 2 to 3 years after starting treatment.[28,30,31] Most of these patients have disease that relapses only in the brain, and nearly all of those with CNS relapse die of their cranial metastases. The risk of developing CNS metastases can be reduced by more than 50% with the administration of PCI.[30]Evidence (role of PCI):A meta-analysis of seven randomized trials evaluated the value of PCI for patients in complete remission. The addition of PCI improved the rates of brain recurrence, disease-free survival, and OS. The 3-year OS rate increased from 15% to 21% with PCI.[30][Level of evidence A1]The randomized RTOG-0212 study (NCT00005062) included 720 patients with LD SCLC in complete remission after chemoradiation therapy. The trial demonstrated that standard-dose PCI (25 Gy in 10 fractions) was as effective as, and less toxic than, higher doses of brain radiation.[32]Randomized trials such as  RTOG-0212 (NCT00005062)   showed that doses higher than 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions do not improve long-term survival.[32-34]Neurological sequelaeRetrospective studies have shown that long-term survivors of SCLC (>2 years from the start of treatment) have a high incidence of CNS impairment.[28,31,35-37] Prospective studies have shown that patients treated with PCI do not have significantly worse neuropsychological function than patients not treated with PCI.[37] Most patients with SCLC have neuropsychological abnormalities before the start of PCI and have no detectable neurological decline for as long as 2 years after the start of PCI.[37] Patients treated for SCLC continue to have declining neuropsychological function after 2 years from the start of treatment.[35-37] Additional neuropsychological testing of patients beyond 2 years from the start of treatment is needed before concluding that PCI does not contribute to the decline in intellectual function.Treatment options for older patients The optimal therapeutic approach in older patients remains unclear. A population analysis showed that increasing age was associated with decreased performance status and increased comorbidity.[38] Older patients were less likely to be treated with combined chemoradiation therapy, more intensive chemotherapy, and PCI. Older patients were also less likely to respond to therapy and had poorer survival outcomes. Whether these findings were a result of age and its associated comorbidities or suboptimal treatment delivery remains uncertain.No specific phase III trial in older patients with LD SCLC has been reported. However, three secondary analyses of two cooperative group trials evaluating outcomes in patients aged 70 years or older have been published.[39-41] The survival outcomes for the older patients were identical to those of their younger counterparts in both trials. The older patients experienced more toxic effects, particularly hematological, compared with younger patients. There was a significant increase in treatment-related mortality in the EST-3588 trial that compared etoposide and cisplatin with either once-daily or twice-daily radiation therapy (1% for patients aged <70 years vs. 10% for patients aged ≥70 years; P = .01).[40] Because the older patients enrolled in these phase III trials may not be representative of LD SCLC patients in the general population, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these results to the general population of older patients.Current Clinical TrialsUse our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

      "In This SectionSpecial DietsVegetarian or vegan dietMacrobiotic dietKetogenic dietDietary SupplementsVitamin CProbioticsMelatoninOral glutamineSpecial DietsMaintaining adequate nutrition while undergoing treatment for cancer is imperative because it can reduce treatment-related side effects, prevent delays in treatment, and help maintain quality of life.[1] However, many patients view their diet as a way to enhance treatment effectiveness, minimize treatment-related toxicities, or target the cancer itself, often by following a specific diet with supposed cancer-fighting benefits or by taking dietary supplements. Patients are likely to search the internet and other lay sources of information for dietary approaches to manage cancer risk and to improve prognosis. Unfortunately, much of this information is not supported by a sufficient evidence base.The sections below summarize the state of the science on some of the most popular diets and dietary supplements.Vegetarian or vegan dietA vegetarian diet is popular, is easy to implement, and, if followed carefully, does not result in nutritional deficiencies. There is strong evidence that a vegetarian diet reduces the incidence of many types of cancer, especially cancers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.[2] However, it is unknown how following a vegetarian or vegan diet can affect treatment-induced symptoms, cancer therapies, or outcomes for someone undergoing cancer therapy. There are no published clinical trials, pilot studies, or case reports on the effectiveness of a vegetarian diet for the management of cancer therapy and symptoms. There is no evidence suggesting a benefit of adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet upon diagnosis or while undergoing cancer therapy. On the other hand, there is no evidence that an individual who follows a vegetarian or vegan diet before cancer therapy should abandon it upon starting treatment.The Men’s Eating and Living (MEAL) Study (CALGB 70807 [Alliance]) was a randomized trial of men with early-stage prostate cancer. It compared participants who were managed with active surveillance and behavioral counseling with a control group who received no counseling.[3][Level of evidence: I]  The study found that the intervention to increase vegetable intake was successful—there was a statistically significant increase in consumption. However, time to cancer progression did not differ between the two groups.Macrobiotic dietA macrobiotic diet varies according to a person’s sex, their level of activity, and the climate (and season) where they live, among other variables. It is a high-carbohydrate,  low-fat, plant-based diet stemming from philosophical principles promoting a healthy way of living. The diet consists of 35% to 50% (by weight) whole grains, 25% to 35% vegetables, 5% to 10% soup, 5% to 10% cooked vegetables and sea vegetables, and 5% to 10% fish.Although there are anecdotal reports of the effectiveness of a macrobiotic diet as an alternative cancer therapy, none has been published in peer-reviewed, scientific journals. No clinical trials, observational studies, or pilot studies have examined the diet as a complementary or alternative therapy for cancer. In fact, two reviews of the diet concluded that there is no scientific evidence for the use of a macrobiotic diet in cancer treatment.[4,5] Because the current research is severely lacking, recommendations for or against the diet in conjunction with standard cancer treatment cannot be made.  No current clinical trials are studying the role of the macrobiotic diet in cancer therapy.Ketogenic dietA ketogenic diet has been well established as an effective alternative treatment for some cases of epilepsy and has gained popularity for use in conjunction with standard treatments for glioblastoma. The theory behind the diet as cancer treatment is that reducing glucose availability to a tumor can reduce tumor activity, and that this reduction can be achieved through entering a state of ketosis via the ketogenic diet’s increased fat intake and restriction of carbohydrates.The ketogenic diet can be difficult to follow and relies more on exact proportions of macronutrients (typically a 4:1 ratio of fat to carbohydrates and protein) than other complementary and  alternative medicine (CAM) diets.Most studies have focused on the diet’s feasibility, tolerability, and safety, all of which have been shown for patients with glioblastoma at various stages of the disease.[6-8] Because safety and feasibility have been proven, several trials are recruiting patients to study the effectiveness of the ketogenic diet on glioblastoma. Therefore, it is safe for a patient diagnosed with glioblastoma to start a ketogenic diet if implemented properly and under the guidance of a registered dietitian.[9] However, effectiveness for symptom and disease management remains  unknown.Similarly, findings from a study that compared the acceptability and adverse effects of a ketogenic diet to the American Cancer Society's high-fiber, low-fat diet among women with ovarian or endometrial cancer found no differences between groups over 12 weeks. Further, the findings indicated that the ketogenic diet was both safe and acceptable.[10] The effectiveness for symptom and disease management for ovarian or endometrial cancer also remains unknown.Dietary SupplementsVitamin CFor  information about the use of intravenous vitamin C as a treatment for people with cancer, see Intravenous Vitamin C.ProbioticsThe use of probiotics has become prevalent within and outside of cancer therapy. Strong research has shown that probiotic supplementation during radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both is well tolerated and can help prevent radiation- and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, especially in those receiving radiation to the abdomen.[11-13] If a patient is undergoing radiation to the abdomen or receiving a chemotherapy agent with diarrhea as a common side effect, starting a probiotic supplement upon  initiation of therapy could be beneficial. Evidence is also emerging for possible benefits of probiotics for immunotherapy-induced toxicities, particularly in the colon.[14]MelatoninMelatonin is a hormone produced endogenously that has been used as a CAM supplement (along with chemotherapy or radiation therapy) for targeting tumor activity and for reducing treatment-related symptoms, primarily for solid tumors.Several studies have shown tumor response to, or disease control with, chemotherapy alongside oral melatonin, as opposed to chemotherapy alone. One study has shown tumor response with melatonin in conjunction with radiation therapy.[15-20] The combination of melatonin and chemotherapy may, in fact, increase survival time by up to 5 years compared with chemotherapy alone. However, another study did not demonstrate increased survival with melatonin, but did demonstrate improved quality of life.[21]Melatonin taken in conjunction with chemotherapy may help reduce or prevent some treatment-related side effects and toxicities that can delay treatment, reduce doses, and negatively affect quality of life. Melatonin supplementation has been associated with significant reductions in neuropathy and neurotoxicity, myelosuppression, thrombocytopenia, cardiotoxicity, stomatitis, asthenia, and malaise.[16,17,19,22] However, one study found no benefit in taking supplemental melatonin for reducing toxicities or improving quality of life.[23]Overall, several small studies show some evidence supporting melatonin supplementation alongside chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both for solid tumor treatment, aiding tumor response, and reducing toxicities. Negative side effects for melatonin supplementation have not been found. Therefore, it may be appropriate to provide oral melatonin in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation therapy to a patient with an advanced solid tumor.Oral glutamineGlutamine is an amino acid that is especially important for GI mucosal cells and their replication. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy often damage these cells, causing mucositis and diarrhea, which can lead to treatment delays and dose reductions and severely affect quality of life. Some evidence suggests that oral glutamine can reduce both of those toxicities by aiding in faster healing of the mucosal cells and entire GI tract.For patients receiving chemotherapy who are at high risk of developing mucositis, either because of previous mucositis or having received known mucositis-causing chemotherapy, oral glutamine may reduce the severity and incidence of mucositis.[24-26]For patients receiving radiation therapy to the abdomen, oral glutamine may reduce the severity of diarrhea and can lead to fewer treatment delays.[27,28] However, one study found no benefit to oral glutamine for preventing chemotherapy-related diarrhea.[29]In addition to reducing GI toxicities, oral glutamine may also reduce peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving the chemotherapy agent paclitaxel.[30] Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to further determine the effectiveness of oral glutamine in treating peripheral neuropathy.Oral glutamine is a safe, simple, and relatively low-cost supplement that may reduce severe chemotherapy- and radiation-induced toxicities.ReferencesLis CG, Gupta D, Lammersfeld CA, et al.: Role of nutritional status in predicting quality of life outcomes in cancer--a systematic review of the epidemiological literature.

      "Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about nutrition before, during, and after cancer treatment. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.Reviewers and UpdatesThis summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:be discussed at a meeting,be cited with text, orreplace or update an existing article that is already cited.Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.The lead reviewers for Nutrition in Cancer Care are:Marilyn J. Hammer, PhD, DC, RN, FAAN (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute)Jared R. Lowe, MD, HMDC (University of North Carolina School of Medicine)Kristina B. Newport, MD, FAAHPM, HMDC (Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute at Milton S. Hershey Medical Center)Maria Petzel, RD, CSO, LD, CNSC, FAND (University of TX MD Anderson Cancer Center)Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's Email Us.

      "Types of Childhood Tracheobronchial Tumors\n",
      "Go to Patient VersionPrimary lung tumors are rare in children and histologically  quite diverse.[1] A review of primary malignant epithelial lung tumors using the National Cancer Data Base found that the most common primary malignant pediatric lung neoplasms were carcinoid tumors (63%) followed by mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the lung (18%).[2]Tracheobronchial tumors are a heterogeneous group of primary endobronchial lesions. Although adenoma implies a benign process, all varieties of tracheobronchial tumors occasionally  display malignant behavior. Most primary lung tumors are malignant. In a review of 383 primary pulmonary neoplasms in children,  76% were malignant and 24% were benign.[3] The following histological types have been identified (see Figure 1):[4-10]Carcinoid tumor (neuroendocrine tumor of the bronchus). Carcinoid tumors account for 80% to 85% of all tracheobronchial tumors in children.[4-8]; [11][Level of evidence C1] It is the most common tracheobronchial tumor.Mucoepidermoid carcinoma. A slow-growing vascular polypoid mass of the airway that is the second most common (10%) pediatric tracheobronchial tumor.Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. These low-grade tumors account for 1% of pediatric tracheobronchial tumors, are commonly located in the upper trachea, and rarely metastasize.  Intrabronchial (pulmonary) inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are incredibly rare compared with other sites of disease. For more information, see Childhood Pulmonary Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors Treatment.Rhabdomyosarcoma.Granular cell tumors. Malignant transformation has not been documented in pediatric patients.EnlargeFigure 1.  The most representative primary tracheobronchial tumors are described with their more frequent location.

      "changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About NeuroblastomaRevised text to state that the incidence is 8.3 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years. Also added text to state that the overall incidence of neuroblastoma cases in the United States has remained stable (cited Campbell et al. as reference 9).Added text about the epidemiological trends in incidence and outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma between 2003 and 2019 based on the United States Cancer Statistics database and the National Program of Cancer Registries survival database.Added text to state that with increased availability of sequencing techniques, the spectrum of germline alterations seen in patients with neuroblastoma is expanding. For example, one study identified a series of 11 patients with germline pathogenic variants in SMARCA4 (cited Witkowski et al. as reference 29). Also added text to state that BARD1, ERCC2, CHEK2, and MSH3 were the genes in which variants were most commonly observed. Variants in BARD1, EZH2, ALK, PTCH1, and MSH3 were specifically enriched in patients with neuroblastoma, compared with controls.Genomic and Biological Features of NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that next-generation sequencing or  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to identify TERT alterations. One study identified TERT rearrangements by FISH in 6% of all patients with neuroblastic tumors regardless of risk group and in 12.4% of patients with high-risk neuroblastic tumors (cited Yu et al. as reference 42).Stage Information for NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that one study of 50 children with neuroblastoma evaluated the role of gadolinium contrast as part of magnetic resonance imaging scans. Assessment of tumor size and image-defined risk factors appeared similar regardless of whether gadolinium was used (cited Morin et al. as reference 13).Treatment of High-Risk NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that these more favorable outcomes for patients with stage 4N disease were confirmed in a single-institution study of 51 patients (cited Kushner et al. as reference 5).Added text to state that an updated report describes the results of a propensity matching analysis that compared patients who were treated with eflornithine with patients in  the ANBL0032 trial who were not treated with eflornithine (cited Oesterheld et al. as reference 57). Propensity matching generally balanced differences in available patient characteristics. In the matched analysis, patients in the eflornithine cohort had statistically significantly higher event-free survival and overall survival, compared with patients in the non-eflornithine cohort. The authors note that uncontrolled confounders may exist in this nonrandomized comparison. Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of eflornithine as continuation therapy in December 2023.This summary is written and maintained by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is\n",

The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium. Signs and symptoms of ovarian low malignant potential tumor include pain or swelling in the abdomen.Ovarian low malignant potential tumor may not cause early signs or symptoms. If you do have signs or symptoms, they may include the following:Pain or swelling in the abdomen.Pain in the pelvis.Gastrointestinal problems, such as gas, bloating, or constipation.These signs and symptoms may be caused by other conditions. If they get worse or do not go away on their own, check with your doctor.Tests that examine the ovaries are used to diagnose and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor.The following tests and procedures may be used:Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum.    A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A Pap test of the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.EnlargePelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.EnlargeAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is passed over the surface of the abdomen. The ultrasound transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).Other patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound. \n",

      "EnlargeTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\n",

      " Adverse Effects\n",
      "Serious adverse effects of acupuncture are rare.  Reported accidents and infections appear to be related to violations of sterile procedure, negligence of the practitioner, or both.[1,2] A systematic review of case reports on the safety of acupuncture, involving 98 papers published in the English language from 22 countries during the period from 1965 to 1999, found only 202 incidents. The number of incidents appeared to decline as training standards and licensure requirements were enhanced. Among the 118 (60%) reported incidents involving infection, 94 (80%) involved hepatitis, occurring mainly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Very few hepatitis or other infections associated with acupuncture have been reported since 1988, when widespread use of disposable needles was introduced and national certification requirements for clean-needle techniques were developed and enforced as an acupuncture licensure requirement.[3,4] Because cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy are immunocompromised,  precautions must be taken and strict clean-needle techniques must be applied when acupuncture treatment is given.[5] Minor adverse effects of acupuncture such as the following, have been reported:Pain at needling sites.Hematoma.Tiredness.Lightheadedness.Drowsiness.Localized skin irritation.These minor adverse effects can be minimized by appropriate patient management, including local pressing and massage at the needling site after treatment.[6,7] ReferencesLao L: Acupuncture techniques and devices.

      "Summary of the Evidence for Acupuncture Treatment of Cancer-Related Symptoms\n",
      "To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for cancer, the strength of the evidence (i.e., the levels of\n",
      "evidence) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever\n",
      "possible.  To qualify for a level of evidence analysis, a study must:Be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.Report on a therapeutic outcome or outcomes, such as tumor response, improvement in survival, or measured improvement in quality of life.Describe clinical findings in sufficient detail that a meaningful evaluation can be made.Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., endpoints) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For an explanation of the scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis, see the Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.It is noteworthy that almost all reported clinical studies on the effects of acupuncture on cancer or cancer therapy–related symptoms focus on symptom management rather than the disease itself. Investigations into the effects of acupuncture on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, many of which were randomized and well-controlled, produced the most convincing findings.  A number of randomized controlled trials have reported on the effect of acupuncture in alleviating other cancer treatment-associated side effects, with many showing promising evidence supporting the use of acupuncture.  Additional phase III clinical trials are ongoing.  \n",

      "Go to Health Professional VersionCannabis, also known as marijuana,  is a plant grown in many parts of the world. It makes a resin (thick substance)        that contains compounds called cannabinoids  (see Question 1).By federal law, possessing Cannabis is illegal in the United States outside of approved research settings. However, a growing number of states, territories, and the District of Columbia have passed laws to legalize medical and/or recreational marijuana (see Question 1).Cannabinoids are chemicals in Cannabis that cause drug-like effects in  the body,   including   the central nervous system  and the immune system (see Question 2).The main psychoactive cannabinoid in Cannabis  is delta-9-THC. Another  active cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD), which may relieve pain, lower inflammation, and decrease anxiety without causing the \"high\" of delta-9-THC (see Question 2).Cannabinoids  can be taken by mouth, inhaled, or sprayed under the tongue (see Question 4).Cannabis and cannabinoids have been studied for  relief of pain, nausea and vomiting, anxiety, and loss of appetite  caused by cancer or the side effects of cancer therapies (see Question 6).Two cannabinoid drugs (dronabinol and nabilone) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (see Question 6 and Question 8).The FDA has not approved Cannabis or cannabinoids for use as a cancer treatment (see Question 8).\n",

      "Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is a plant first grown in Central Asia that is now grown in many parts of the world. The Cannabis plant  makes a resin (thick substance) that contains compounds called cannabinoids. Some cannabinoids are psychoactive (affects your mind or mood).  In the United States, Cannabis is a controlled substance and has been classified as a    Schedule I agent (a drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use).Hemp is a mixture of the Cannabis plant with very low levels of psychoactive compounds. Hemp oil or cannabidiol (CBD)  are made from extracts of industrial hemp, while hemp seed oil is an edible fatty oil that contains few or  no cannabinoids.   Hemp is not a controlled substance. For information on medicinal Cannabis products, see the General Information section in the health professional version of Cannabis and Cannabinoids.Clinical trials  that study Cannabis for cancer treatment are limited. To start  a clinical trial with  Cannabis in the United States, researchers must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA, have a Schedule I license from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and have approval from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.By federal law, possessing Cannabis (marijuana) is illegal in the United States unless it is used in approved research settings. However, a growing number of states, territories, and the District of Columbia have passed laws to legalize medical and/or recreational marijuana. (See Question 3).\n",
      "What are cannabinoids?Cannabinoids, also known as phytocannabinoids, are chemicals in Cannabis  that cause drug-like effects     in the body, including the central nervous system and the immune system. Over 100 cannabinoids have been found in Cannabis. The main psychoactive cannabinoid in Cannabis  is delta-9-THC. Another  active cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD).Cannabinoids may help treat the side effects of cancer and cancer treatment. If  Cannabis is illegal, how do some patients with cancer in the United States use it?Although federal law prohibits the use of Cannabis, the map below shows the states and territories that have legalized Cannabis for medical use. Some other states have legalized only one ingredient in Cannabis, such as cannabidiol (CBD), and these states are not included in the map. Medical marijuana laws  vary from state to state.EnlargeA map showing the U.S. states and territories that  have approved the medical use of Cannabis.How is Cannabis given or taken?\n",
      "Cannabis may be taken by mouth (in baked goods or as an herbal tea) or may be inhaled. When taken by mouth, the main psychoactive part of  Cannabis (delta-9-THC) goes through the liver  and is changed into a different psychoactive chemical (11-OH-THC).When Cannabis is smoked and inhaled, cannabinoids quickly enter the bloodstream. The psychoactive chemical (11-OH-THC) is  made in smaller amounts than when taken by mouth.Clinical trials are studying a medicine made from an extract of  Cannabis that contains specific amounts of cannabinoids. This medicine is  sprayed under the tongue.Have any laboratory or animal studies\n",
      "         been done using Cannabis or cannabinoids?\n",
      "\tIn laboratory studies, tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies, tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people.For information on laboratory and animal studies done using cannabinoids, see the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section in the health professional version of Cannabis and Cannabinoids.Have any  studies of Cannabis or cannabinoids been done in people with cancer?No ongoing studies of Cannabis as a treatment for cancer in people  have been found  in the CAM on PubMed database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.Small studies have been done, but the results have not been reported or suggest a need for larger studies.An oral spray of Cannabis extract given  with temozolomide to treat  recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.CBD taken by mouth to treat  acute graft-versus-host disease in patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. \n",
      "Cannabis and cannabinoids have been studied as ways to manage side effects of cancer and cancer therapies.Nausea and vomitingCannabis and cannabinoids have been studied in the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by cancer or cancer treatment:Delta-9-THC taken by mouth:  Two cannabinoid drugs, dronabinol and nabilone, approved  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are given to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy in patients who have not responded to standard antiemetic therapy. Clinical trials have shown that both dronabinol and nabilone work as well as or better than other drugs to relieve nausea and vomiting.Oral spray with delta-9-THC and CBD:  Nabiximols, a Cannabis extract given as a mouth spray, was shown in a small randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial  in Spain to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.Inhaled Cannabis: Small trials have studied inhaled Cannabis  for the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.Newer drugs given for nausea  caused by chemotherapy have not been compared with  Cannabis or cannabinoids in patients with cancer.There is growing interest in treating  children for symptoms such as nausea with Cannabis and cannabinoids, but studies are limited. The American Academy of Pediatrics has not endorsed Cannabis and cannabinoid use because of concerns about its effect on brain development.AppetiteThe ability of cannabinoids to increase appetite has been studied:Delta-9-THC taken by mouth: A clinical trial compared delta-9-THC (dronabinol) and a standard drug (megestrol, an appetite stimulant) in patients with advanced cancer and  loss of appetite. Results showed that delta-9-THC did not help increase appetite or weight gain in patients with advanced cancer compared with megestrol.Inhaled Cannabis: There are no published studies of the effect of inhaled  Cannabis on patients with cancer who have loss of appetite. Pain reliefCannabis and cannabinoids have been studied in the treatment of pain:Vaporized Cannabis with opioids:  In a study of 21 patients with chronic pain, vaporized Cannabis given with morphine relieved pain better than morphine alone, while vaporized Cannabis given with oxycodone did not give greater pain relief. Further studies are needed.Inhaled Cannabis: Randomized controlled trials of inhaled Cannabis in patients with peripheral neuropathy or other nerve pain found that inhaled Cannabis relieved pain better than inhaled placebo. A retrospective study of patients who received an anticancer drug for gastrointestinal cancers found that those who also inhaled Cannabis had less nerve pain, including those who took Cannabis before they began the anticancer drug.Cannabis plant extract:  A study of Cannabis extract that was sprayed under the tongue found it helped  patients with advanced cancer whose pain was not relieved by  strong opioids alone.  In another study, patients who were given lower doses of cannabinoid spray showed better pain control and less sleep loss than patients who received a placebo.  Control of cancer-related  pain in some patients was better without the need for   higher doses of Cannabis extract spray or higher doses of their other pain   medicines. Adverse events were related to high doses of cannabinoid spray. Delta-9-THC taken by mouth: Two small clinical trials of oral delta-9-THC showed that it relieved cancer pain. In the first study, patients had good pain relief, less nausea and vomiting, and better appetite. A second study showed that delta-9-THC could relieve pain as well as codeine. An observational  study of nabilone also reported less cancer pain along with less nausea, anxiety,     and distress when compared with no treatment. Neither dronabinol nor nabilone is approved by the FDA for pain relief.Non-specific Cannabis products: A randomized controlled trial studied  patients with advanced cancer who used  Cannabis in addition to opioids early in treatment compared to patients who added Cannabis later in treatment. Patients who were given Cannabis later showed an increase in  opioid use during the 3-month study. Opioid use was stable in patients who began Cannabis use earlier. There were no changes in symptoms or adverse effects between the two groups.  Over 100 different Cannabis products were given during the study. Anxiety and sleepCannabis and cannabinoids have been studied in the treatment of anxiety.Inhaled Cannabis: A small case series found that patients who inhaled Cannabis had improved mood, improved sense of well-being, and less anxiety. In another study, 74 patients newly diagnosed with head and neck cancer who were  Cannabis users were matched to 74 nonusers. The Cannabis users had lower anxiety or depression and less pain or discomfort than the nonusers. The   Cannabis users were also less tired, had more appetite, and reported greater feelings of well-being.Oral Cannabis  oil: A randomized controlled trial studied two different doses of oral Cannabis oil in patients with brain cancer that could not be removed by surgery or had come back. Physical side effects such as sleep were noted to be better in  the 1:1 ratio dose group. Both doses were well tolerated without any adverse effects.Relief of cancer symptoms with cannabidiol oilCannabidiol (CBD) is a Cannabis compound that does not produce a \"high\" linked to  Cannabis, but is felt to have possible health benefits. CBD oil  has been studied for  relief of  cancer symptoms. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of 144 patients studied the effect of oral CBD oil on cancer symptoms. All patients were treated by palliative care specialists. No difference was found in relief of cancer symptoms between the oral CBD group and the placebo group after 14 and 28 days. This trial has several limiting factors involving patients who participated, low levels of symptoms, and high levels of patients who did not complete the study.Have any side effects or risks been reported from Cannabis and cannabinoids?\n",
      "Side effects of Cannabis and cannabinoids can include:Fast heartbeat.Low blood pressure.Muscle relaxation.Bloodshot eyes.Slow digestion.Dizziness.Drowsiness.Depression.Hallucinations.Paranoia.Both Cannabis and cannabinoids may be addictive. Symptoms of withdrawal from cannabinoids include:Being easily annoyed or angered.Trouble sleeping.Unable to stay still.Hot flashes.Nausea and cramping (rare).These symptoms are mild compared with symptoms of withdrawal from opiates and usually go away after a few days.Studies on cancer risk from Cannabis useStudies on the risk of various cancers linked to Cannabis smoking have shown the following: Lung cancer: Because  Cannabis smoke contains many of the same substances as tobacco smoke, there  are concerns about how inhaled Cannabis affects the lungs. A cohort study of men in Africa found that there was an increased risk of lung cancer in tobacco smokers who also inhaled Cannabis. A population study of patients with lung cancer found that low Cannabis use  was not linked to an increased risk of lung cancer or other aerodigestive tract cancers.Testicular cancer: A 1970 study interviewed over 49,000 Swedish men aged 19 to 21 years about their personal history of using  Cannabis at the time  they enlisted in the military and then followed them for up to 42 years. The study did not find a link between those who had \"ever\" used Cannabis  and testicular cancer, but did find that \"heavy\" use of Cannabis (more than 50 times in a lifetime) was linked to more than twice the risk of testicular cancer. The study was limited by the way data was gathered and did not note whether the testicular cancers were seminoma or nonseminoma types or whether Cannabis use also occurred after enlistment.Bladder cancer: A review of bladder cancer rates in Cannabis users and non-users was done in over 84,000 men  who took part in the California Men's Health Study. After more than 16 years of follow-up and adjusting for age, race, ethnic group, and body mass index,  rates of bladder cancer were found to be 45% lower in Cannabis users  than in men who did not report Cannabis use.Larger studies that follow patients over time are needed to find if there is a link between Cannabis use and a higher risk of testicular germ cell tumors.Studies on Cannabis use and impact on cancer treatment Few studies have been done to find out how Cannabis interacts with conventional treatment. A retrospective observational study in Israel showed that Cannabis reduced the effect of immunotherapy. A prospective observational study of immunotherapy and Cannabis in patients with metastatic cancer reported that the Cannabis users did not benefit from immunotherapy as much as those who did not use Cannabis.Are Cannabis or cannabinoids approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as a cancer treatment  or treatment for cancer-related symptoms or side effects of cancer therapy?\n",
      "\tThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Cannabis or cannabinoids for use as a cancer treatment.Cannabis is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of any cancer-related symptom or side effect of cancer therapy.  Two cannabinoids (dronabinol and nabilone) are approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy in patients who have not responded to antiemetic therapy.\n",

      " According to the context provided, there is evidence that some vitamins, minerals, and herbs may support prostate health and potentially influence the risk of prostate cancer. However, it's important to note that while these supplements may provide additional nutrients, their use is not always warranted or beneficial for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context mentions several studies that have investigated the use of vitamins and minerals, such as selenium, vitamin E, and vitamin D, in relation to prostate cancer. For instance, a study published in 2003 suggested that selenium supplementation may reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer in men with low selenium levels (1). Another study from 2009 found that taking vitamin E and selenium together did not significantly reduce the risk of prostate cancer or improve survival compared to placebo (2).\n",

      " The context does not provide specific information regarding how medical professionals balance the goal of removing all cancer cells with the risk of causing major disfigurement. However, it does mention several studies that explore the financial burden and impact on quality of life for cancer patients undergoing treatment. These studies highlight the importance of considering both the clinical outcomes and the patient's perspective when making treatment decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "One study discussed in the context, \"Patient Attitudes Regarding the Cost of Illness in Cancer Care,\" found that patients prioritize survival over cost and quality of life concerns. Another study, \"Does economic burden influence quality of life in breast cancer survivors?\", reported that financial burden can negatively impact a patient's quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of balancing the goal of removing all cancer cells with the risk of causing major disfigurement, medical professionals must consider various factors such as the stage and type of cancer, the patient's overall health, treatment options, and their individual preferences and values. They may discuss these concerns with their patients and involve a multidisciplinary team to help make informed decisions that prioritize both clinical effectiveness and patient well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is essential for medical professionals to communicate openly with their patients about the potential risks and benefits of various treatment options, including the possibility of disfigurement or other side effects. They should also discuss available resources and support systems to help patients manage any financial burden associated with their care. By taking a holistic approach that considers both clinical outcomes and patient perspectives, medical professionals can strive to provide high-quality, personalized cancer care while minimizing the risk of major disfigurement.\n",

      "In summary, the context does not directly address the question regarding how medical professionals balance the goal of removing all cancer cells with the risk of causing major disfigurement. However, it highlights the importance of considering both clinical outcomes and patient perspectives when making treatment decisions and emphasizes the need for open communication between patients and healthcare providers.\n",

      "Go to Health Professional VersionKey PointsGood communication between people with cancer, their family,  and the health care team is important in cancer care.Families may experience communication challenges.Good communication between people with cancer, their family,  and the health care team is important in cancer care.Good communication with your family and the health care team can create a trusting relationship that positively affects many parts of your cancer journey. The goals of good communication in cancer care are to:Build a trusting relationship with your health care team.\tLearn from your health care team about your cancer diagnosis.Discuss your options for treatment and care throughout your cancer journey.Improve your well-being and quality of life. You will face many decisions when you are diagnosed with cancer. Tell your health care team about concerns you may have during treatment, and if you have problems coping with the cancer diagnosis and journey.Studies show that there are many positive results  when people with cancer and their doctors communicate well during cancer care. Positive results include:More satisfaction with care.More likely to follow through with treatment.Better quality of life.Reduced anxiety and other symptoms.More likely to take part in a clinical trial.Improved knowledge of the disease and prognosis.Preferred care is received at end of life.Ask for a patient navigator  if you need help communicating with your doctor. A patient navigator can guide you through the health care system and help you communicate with your health care team, so you get the information you need to make decisions about your care. Families may experience communication challenges.Cancer can be an emotional experience. You may want to hide feelings of distress and sadness and act normal  to protect your family and friends. This is also often true for friends and family. Talking about cancer-related issues may help reduce stress for you  and your family. Family-focused psychotherapy may also benefit you and your family.\n",

      "Key PointsPeople may have a preferred way to receive information from their health care team.Culture can also affect communication.People may have a preferred way to receive information from their health care team.You may ask for written instructions and  phone calls, or you may prefer texts and emails. Let your health care team know how you want to receive your information about your cancer and cancer treatment.Culture can also affect communication.Some cultures place a greater emphasis on communication with the family as a whole unit, while other cultures focus more on the patient’s ability to make their own decisions. Tell your health care team how much information you want to receive.Your religious beliefs may be a source of strength and coping for you. Tell your health care team about any spiritual and religious needs and concerns you want them to know about. For more information, see Spirituality in Cancer Care.\n",

      "Key PointsMany parents want to know their child’s prognosis.Children with cancer need information that is right for their age.Children may wish to know what is going on when someone they love has cancer.Many parents want to know their child’s prognosis.When your child has cancer, you will likely have questions about how serious the cancer is, and your child’s chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis. Learning your child’s prognosis may be upsetting, but knowing this information can help you and your loved ones make decisions. Your child’s doctor is in the best position to talk with you about your child’s prognosis, if you want to know that information.Children with cancer need information that is right for their age.Studies show that children with cancer want to know about their illness and how it will be treated. The amount of information a child may want to know  depends in part on their age. Most children worry about how their illness and treatment will affect their daily lives and the people around them. Studies also show that children have less doubt and fear when they are given age-appropriate  information about their illness, even if it is bad news.Children may wish to know what is going on when someone they love has cancer.When a parent has cancer, the child may have high levels of distress. Children may also experience anxiety and distress when they see a sibling going through cancer therapy or dying. Children do better when family members or the health care team talk with them about what to expect and answer their questions.

      "About This PDQ Summary\n",
      "About PDQPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.Purpose of This SummaryThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about communicating with the cancer patient and his or her family.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.Reviewers and UpdatesEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\n",
      "The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board.\n",
      "Clinical Trial InformationA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n",
      "Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).\n",

      "Go to Health Professional VersionCancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. In 2023, about 1.9 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States. In addition to the physical problems and emotional distress caused by cancer, the high costs of care are also a burden to patients, their families, and to the public. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer  is lowered. Hopefully, this will reduce the burden of cancer and lower the number of deaths caused by cancer.Cancer is not a single disease but a group of related diseases. Many things in our genes, our lifestyle, and the environment around us may increase or decrease our risk of getting cancer.Scientists are  studying many different  ways to  help prevent cancer, including the following:Ways to avoid or control things known to cause cancer.Changes in diet and lifestyle.Finding precancerous conditions early. Precancerous conditions are conditions that may become cancer.Chemoprevention (medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting).Risk-reducing surgery.\n",

      "Carcinogenesis\n",
      "Key PointsCarcinogenesis is the process in which normal cells turn into cancer cells.Changes (mutations) in genes occur during carcinogenesis.Carcinogenesis is the process in which normal cells turn into cancer cells.Carcinogenesis is the series of steps that take place as a normal cell becomes a cancer cell. Cells are the smallest units of the body and they make up the body's tissues. Each cell contains   genes that guide the way the body grows, develops, and repairs itself. There are many genes that control whether a cell lives or dies, divides (multiplies), or takes on special functions, such as becoming a nerve cell or a muscle cell.Changes (mutations) in genes occur during carcinogenesis.Changes (mutations) in genes can cause normal  controls in cells to break down. When this happens, cells do not die when they should and new cells are produced when the body does not need them. The buildup of extra cells may cause a mass (tumor) to form.Tumors can be benign or malignant (cancerous). Malignant tumor cells invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. Benign tumor cells do not invade nearby tissues or spread.\n"

      " Hormone therapy for breast cancer and menopausal hormone therapy serve different purposes and have distinct differences. Hormone therapy for breast cancer refers to the use of drugs that block the production or action of certain hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, to slow or stop the growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells (1). This is in contrast to menopausal hormone therapy, which involves the use of exogenous hormones, typically estrogen and progestogen, to alleviate symptoms associated with menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness (2).\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary difference between these two types of hormonal treatments lies in their goals and mechanisms. Hormone therapy for breast cancer aims to suppress the production or action of hormones that promote the growth of breast cancer cells, whereas menopausal hormone therapy is designed to replace declining levels of endogenous hormones in postmenopausal women to alleviate symptoms (3).\n",
      "\n",
      "The implications of this difference are significant. Hormone therapy for breast cancer can be used both as an adjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence and as a primary treatment for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The goal is to deprive cancer cells of the hormonal stimulation they need to grow (4). In contrast, menopausal hormone therapy is primarily used to manage symptoms associated with menopause and is not recommended for women with a history of breast cancer due to its potential risk of increasing the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence or new primary breast cancers (5).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that while both types of hormonal treatments involve manipulating hormone levels, they do so in different ways. Hormone therapy for breast cancer aims to suppress hormones, whereas menopausal hormone therapy aims to replace declining hormone levels. The side effects and risks associated with each type of treatment are also distinct. For example, side effects of hormone therapy for breast cancer include hot flashes, joint pain, and decreased libido (6). In contrast, side effects of menopausal hormone therapy include increased risk of blood clots, stroke, and breast cancer (7).\n",

      "new information becomes available.  This section describes the latest\n",
      "changes made to this summary as of the date above.General Information About NeuroblastomaRevised text to state that the incidence is 8.3 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years. Also added text to state that the overall incidence of neuroblastoma cases in the United States has remained stable (cited Campbell et al. as reference 9).Added text about the epidemiological trends in incidence and outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma between 2003 and 2019 based on the United States Cancer Statistics database and the National Program of Cancer Registries survival database.Added text to state that with increased availability of sequencing techniques, the spectrum of germline alterations seen in patients with neuroblastoma is expanding. For example, one study identified a series of 11 patients with germline pathogenic variants in SMARCA4 (cited Witkowski et al. as reference 29). Also added text to state that BARD1, ERCC2, CHEK2, and MSH3 were the genes in which variants were most commonly observed. Variants in BARD1, EZH2, ALK, PTCH1, and MSH3 were specifically enriched in patients with neuroblastoma, compared with controls.Genomic and Biological Features of NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that next-generation sequencing or  fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to identify TERT alterations. One study identified TERT rearrangements by FISH in 6% of all patients with neuroblastic tumors regardless of risk group and in 12.4% of patients with high-risk neuroblastic tumors (cited Yu et al. as reference 42).Stage Information for NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that one study of 50 children with neuroblastoma evaluated the role of gadolinium contrast as part of magnetic resonance imaging scans. Assessment of tumor size and image-defined risk factors appeared similar regardless of whether gadolinium was used (cited Morin et al. as reference 13).Treatment of High-Risk NeuroblastomaAdded text to state that these more favorable outcomes for patients with stage 4N disease were confirmed in a single-institution study of 51 patients (cited Kushner et al. as reference 5).Added text to state that an updated report describes the results of a propensity matching analysis that compared patients who were treated with eflornithine with patients in  the ANBL0032 trial who were not treated with eflornithine (cited Oesterheld et al. as reference 57). Propensity matching generally balanced differences in available patient characteristics. In the matched analysis, patients in the eflornithine cohort had statistically significantly higher event-free survival and overall survival, compared with patients in the non-eflornithine cohort. The authors note that uncontrolled confounders may exist in this nonrandomized comparison. Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of eflornithine as continuation therapy in December 2023.This summary is written and maintained by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board, which is\n",

      "Oncologist Anthony L. Back, M.D., a national expert on doctor-patient communications, talks with one of his patients about what she'd like to know of her prognosis.\n",
      "Credit: National Cancer Institute\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have cancer, you may have questions about how serious your cancer is and your chances of survival. The estimate of how the disease will go for you is called prognosis. It can be hard to understand what prognosis means and also hard to talk about, even for doctors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many Factors Can Affect Your Prognosis\n",
      "Some of the factors that affect prognosis include:\n",
      "The type of cancer and where it is in your body\n",
      "The stage of the cancer, which refers to the size of the cancer and if it has spread to other parts of your body\n",
      "The cancer’s grade, which refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope. Grade provides clues about how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread.\n",
      "Certain traits of the cancer cells\n",
      "Your age and how healthy you were before cancer\n",
      "How you respond to treatment\n",
      "Learn more about Cancer Staging and Tumor Grade.\n",
      "Seeking Information About Your Prognosis Is a Personal Decision\n",
      "When you have cancer, you and your loved ones face many unknowns. Understanding your cancer and knowing what to expect can help you and your loved ones make decisions. Some of the decisions you may face include:\n",
      "Which treatment is best for you\n",
      "If you want treatment\n",
      "How to best take care of yourself and manage treatment side effects\n",
      "How to deal with financial and legal matters\n",
      "Many people want to know their prognosis. They find it easier to cope when they know more about their cancer. You may ask your doctor about survival statistics or search for this information on your own. Or, you may find statistics confusing and frightening, and think they are too impersonal to be of value to you. It is up to you to decide how much information you want.\n",
      "If you do decide you want to know more, the doctor who knows the most about your situation is in the best position to discuss your prognosis and explain what the statistics may mean.\n",
      "If you need help coping with your prognosis, you may find our information on Coping With Cancer helpful.\n",
      "Understanding Statistics About Survival\n",
      "Doctors estimate prognosis by using statistics that researchers have collected over many years about people with the same type of cancer. Several types of statistics may be used to estimate prognosis. The most commonly used statistics include:\n",
      "Cancer-specific survival\n",
      "\tThis is the percentage of patients with a specific type and stage of cancer who have not died from their cancer during a certain period of time after diagnosis. The period of time may be 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, etc., with 5 years being the time period most often used. Cancer-specific survival is also called disease-specific survival. In most cases, cancer-specific survival is based on causes of death listed in medical records.\n",
      "Relative survival\n",
      "\tThis statistic is another method used to estimate cancer-specific survival that does not use information about the cause of death. It is the percentage of cancer patients who have survived for a certain period of time after diagnosis compared to people who do not have cancer.\n",
      "Overall survival\n",
      "\tThis is the percentage of people with a specific type and stage of cancer who have not died from any cause during a certain period of time after diagnosis.\n",
      "Disease-free survival\n",
      "\tThis statistic is the percentage of patients who have no signs of cancer during a certain period of time after treatment. Other names for this statistic are recurrence-free or progression-free survival.\n",
      "Because statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to you. Everyone is different. Treatments and how people respond to treatment can differ greatly. Also, it takes years to see the benefit of new treatments and ways of finding cancer. So, the statistics your doctor uses to make a prognosis may not be based on treatments being used today.\n",
      "Still, your doctor may tell you that you have a good prognosis if statistics suggest that your cancer is likely to respond well to treatment. Or, he may tell you that you have a poor prognosis if the cancer is harder to control. Whatever your doctor tells you, keep in mind that a prognosis is an educated guess. Your doctor cannot be certain how it will go for you.\n",
      "Where to Find Cancer Statistics\n",
      "NCI collects and reports on cancer statistics through its SEER Program, which stands for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. From the Cancer Stat Facts page on the SEER web site, you can find answers to the most commonly asked questions about cancer statistics for many cancer types. You can also browse the latest SEER Cancer Statistics Review.\n",
      "If You Decide Not to Have Treatment\n",
      "If you decide not to have treatment, the doctor who knows your situation best is in the best position to discuss your prognosis.\n",
      "Survival statistics most often come from studies that compare treatments with each other, rather than treatment with no treatment. So, it may not be easy for your doctor to give you an accurate prognosis.\n",
      "Understanding the Difference Between Cure and Remission\n",
      "Cure means that there are no traces of your cancer after treatment and the cancer will never come back.\n",
      "Remission means that the signs and symptoms of your cancer are reduced. Remission can be partial or complete. In a complete remission, all signs and symptoms of cancer have disappeared.\n",
      "If you remain in complete remission for 5 years or more, some doctors may say that you are cured. Still, some cancer cells can remain in your body for many years after treatment. These cells may cause the cancer to come back one day. For cancers that return, most do so within the first 5 years after treatment. But, there is a chance that cancer will come back later. For this reason, doctors cannot say for sure that you are cured. The most they can say is that there are no signs of cancer at this time.\n",
      "Because of the chance that cancer can come back, your doctor will monitor you for many years and do tests to look for signs of cancer’s return. They will also look for signs of late side effects from the cancer treatments you received.\n",
      "Video Series\n",
      "This video series explores three cancer patients’ and their doctor’s thoughts and feelings about prognosis. The videos explain key points about prognosis and how doctors and patients can talk about it in a clear and supportive way. Two viewer guides are also available: for patients (PDF-210KB) and for provider care teams (PDF-210KB).\n",

The side effects you have will depend on the type of hormone therapy you receive and how your body responds to it. People respond differently to the same treatment, so not everyone gets the same side effects. Some side effects also differ if you are a man or a woman.\n",

To learn more, talk with the business office where you go for treatment. You can also go to the National Cancer Institute database, Organizations that Offer Support Services and search \"financial assistance.\" Or call toll-free 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) to ask for help.\n",

      "How hormone therapy is given\n",
      "Hormone therapy may be given in many ways:\n",
      "Oral. Hormone therapy comes in pills that you swallow.\n",

      "How hormone therapy may affect you\n",
      "Hormone therapy affects people in different ways. How you feel depends on the type of cancer you have, how advanced it is, the type of hormone therapy you are getting, and the dose. Your doctors and nurses cannot know for certain how you will feel during hormone therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to tell if hormone therapy is working\n",
      "If you are taking hormone therapy for prostate cancer, you will have regular PSA tests. If hormone therapy is working, your PSA levels will stay the same or may even go down. But, if your PSA levels go up, this may be a sign that the treatment is no longer working. If this happens, your doctor will discuss treatment options with you.\n",
      "If you are taking hormone therapy for breast cancer, you will have regular check-ups. Checkups usually include an exam of the neck, underarm, chest, and breast areas. You will have regular mammograms, though you probably won’t need a mammogram of a reconstructed breast. Your doctor may also order other imaging procedures or lab tests.\n",
